CISC 490 Project - Your personal ai pregnancy assistant

[Server Files](https://github.com/kweaver00/peggy-server)

IBM Watson services being used:
- [Document Conversion](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/document-conversion.html)
- [Natural Language Classifier](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/nl-classifier.html)
- [Retrieve and Rank](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/retrieve-rank.html)



Before getting started, I've created docs for an [example commit](./docs/example-commit.md) and [example for documenting REST API end points](./docs/example-rest-api-doc.md).


The server code is hosted on the [server branch](https://github.com/kweaver00/peggy/tree/server). This allows us to use one repo and not download the wrong code to the server.

To view the server branch after you have clone the repo:
```
git checkout server
```
