{"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 1,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "t here\'s a tiny new being developing inside of you-a baby in the making. adorable little fingers and toes are sprouting, eyes and ears are forming, brain cells are rapidly growing. and before you know it, the speck of a fetus inside you will come to resemble the baby of your dreams: fully equipped and suitable for cuddling. not surprisingly, a lot goes into making a baby. happily for babies and the parents who love them, nature\'s incredibly good at what it does. which means that the chances that your baby will be born not only perfectly cuddly, but perfectly healthy, are already excellent. what\'s more, there\'s something you can do to help make those excellent chances even better-while helping yourself to a healthier and more comfortable pregnancy. it\'s something that\'s relatively easy to do (except maybe when you\'re feeling queasy)-and something that you probably already do at least 3 times a day. yes, you guessed it: eat. but the challenge during pregnancy isn\'t just to eat (though that may be challenge enough during those early months)-it\'s to eat as well as you can. think of it this way: eating well when you\'re expecting is one of the first and best gifts you can give your soon-to-arrive bundle of joy-and it\'s a gift that can keep on giving, handing out not just a healthier start in life but a healthier lifetime. the pregnancy diet is an eating plan dedicated to baby\'s good health- and yours. what\'s in it for your baby? among many other impressive benefits, a better chance for a healthy birth-weight, improved brain development, reduced risk for certain birth defects- and as a bonus, believe it or not, better and potentially less picky eating habits as baby grows (a perk you\'ll really appreciate when broccoli\'s on the dinner menu). it may even make it more likely that your yet-to-be-born baby will grow to be a healthier adult. and your baby\'s not the only one who\'s likely to benefit. the pregnancy diet can also increase the chances that you\'ll have a safe pregnancy (some complications, such as anemia, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia, are less common among women who eat well and avoid excess weight gain), a comfortable pregnancy (the right foods can minimize morning sickness, fatigue, heartburn, constipation, and a host of other pregnancy symptoms), better balanced emotions (good nutrition may help moderate those wild mood swings), a full-term pregnancy (in general, moms-to-be who eat regularly and well are less likely to deliver too early), and a speedier postpartum recovery (a well-nourished body can bounce back faster and more easily, and weight that\'s been gained at a sensible rate can be shed more quickly). for more on the many benefits of a healthy diet during pregnancy, see what to expect: eating well when you\'re expecting. luckily, scoring those benefits is a piece of (carrot) cake, especially if you\'re already eating pretty well, and even if you\'re not (you\'ll just have to be a little more selective before bringing fork to mouth). that\'s because the pregnancy diet isn\'t all that different from the average healthy diet. while a few modifications have been made for the pregnant set (not surprisingly, baby making requires more calories and more of certain nutrients), the foundation is the same: a good, balanced mix of lean protein and calcium, whole grains, a rainbow of fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats. sound familiar? it should-after all, it\'s what good nutrition is all about. and here\'s some more good news. even if you\'re coming to your pregnancy (and bellying up to the table) with less than ideal eating habits, changing them to follow the pregnancy diet won\'t be that tough, especially if you\'re committed to making the changes. there are healthy alternatives for almost every less healthy food and beverage you\'ve ever brought to your lips (see box, page 87), which means there are nourishing ways to have your cake (and cookies and chips and even fast food) and eat it, too. plus, there are countless ways to sneak crucial vitamins and minerals into recipes and favorite dishes-so you can pump up your pregnancy nutrition without shortchanging your taste buds. and now for the reality check. what\'s presented in this chapter is the ideal, the best possible plan for eating well when you\'re expecting. something you should strive for, absolutely-but nothing you should stress over. maybe you\'ll choose to follow the diet closely, at least most of the time. or you\'ll follow it loosely, all of the time. or you\'ll do the best you can, which won\'t always be that great-especially when you\'re crazy queasy . . . or when food cravings send you careening into the candy aisle . . . or when reflux keeps coming up. but even if you keep your allegiance to burgers and fries, you\'ll pick up at least a few pointers in the pages

bites count by choosing them (at least most of the time) with baby in mind. all calories are not created equal. choose your calories with care, selecting quality over quantity when you can. it may

100 calories in a handful of almonds. your baby will benefit a lot more from 2,000 nutrient-rich calories daily than from 2,000 mostly empty ones. and your body will show the benefits postpartum as

your baby is. so try not to skip meals. in fact, eating frequently may be the best route to a well-nourished fetus. research shows that moms-to-be who eat at least 5 times a day (3 meals plus 2 snacks

efficient way of netting a protein serving than a turkey burger (about 300 calories). a cup and a half of ice cream (about 500 calories, way more if you\'re choosing the premium stuff) is a fun but less efficient way of scoring a calcium serving than a cup of nonfat frozen yogurt (still fun, but with 200 fewer calories). using the same model of efficiency, choose lean meats over fatty ones, fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products over full-fat versions, grilled or broiled foods over fried, and sauté using a tablespoon of olive oil, not a quarter of a cup. another trick of the efficient-eating trade: select foods that are overachievers in more than 1 daily dozen category, so you can fill 2 or more requirements at once. efficiency is important, too, if you\'re having trouble gaining weight. to start tipping the scale toward a healthier weight gain, choose foods that are dense in nutrients and calories-avocados, nuts, and dried fruits, for instance- that can fill you and your baby out without filling you up too much. carbohydrates are a complex issue. what do you think of when you think of carbs? if it\'s \"extra pounds,\" you\'re not alone. carbs have long been dissed and dismissed out of hand-and off the table-by the weight conscious. and that\'s too bad, especially when it comes to weight conscious expecting moms-who could stand to gain a lot of nutrients (without gaining a lot of weight) by eating the right kind of carbs: the complex kind. sure, refined carbs (white rice, white bread and pastries, white potatoes) are nutritional slackers, adding calories but little else. another downer: they can send blood sugar soaring . . . and then crashing.","title" : "1,000 days to a healthier future"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 5,"author" : "heidi

baked apple but complex carbohydrates (whole grain breads and cereal, brown rice, fruits and veggies, and beans) supply a bundle of b vitamins, trace minerals, protein, and fiber, contributing way more than calories. they\'re good not only for baby, but also for you (they\'ll help keep nausea and constipation in check). and because they are filling and fiber-rich, they\'ll help keep your weight gain in check, too. research suggests yet another bonus for complex carb consumers: eating plenty of fiber may reduce the risk of developing gestational diabetes. sweet nothings are exactly that. there\'s no gentle way to put this: sugar calories, sadly, are empty calories. and empty calories aren\'t sugar\'s only shortfall. a heavy consumption has been linked to a variety of health concerns, from obesity to colon cancer. in pregnancy, too much sugar can turn into too many pounds, but it can also increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes, as well as tooth decay (you\'re already extra susceptible when you\'re expecting). another strike against sugar: large amounts are likely to show up in nutritionally underachieving foods and drinks you\'re probably better off skipping anyway (say, candy and soda). refined sugar goes by many names on the supermarket shelves, including corn syrup and dehydrated cane juice. honey, an unrefined sugar, has a nutritional edge because it contains disease-fighting antioxidants. plus, it is more likely to find its way into more nutritious foods. still, it\'s smart to try limiting your intake of sugar in all its forms. satisfy your sweet tooth the wholesome way by substituting fruit (fresh, dried, or freeze-dried), fruit juice concentrate, and fruit purees for sugar whenever you can. you can also find sweet revenge in the calorie-free or low-calorie sugar substitutes that seem to be safe for pregnancy use (see page 111). good foods remember where they came from. nature knows a thing or two about nutrition. so it\'s not surprising that the most nutritious foods are often the ones that haven\'t strayed far from their original, nature-formulated recipe. choose fresh vegetables and fruits when they\'re in season, or nothing-added frozen when fresh are unavailable or you don\'t have time to prepare them. freeze-dried is another nutritious (and convenient) way to go- you\'ll find the flavor of freeze-dried fruits and veggies is more intense, the texture crunchy and satisfying, and the calorie counts low compared with traditionally dried. and when it comes to","title" : "try these instead"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

then, without feeling guilty about it. so treat yourself to a treat when you really want one, and without a side of eater\'s remorse. but even as you venture down the path of least nutritious, try to pump it up-add fresh strawberries and walnuts to your sundae, choose a dark chocolate bar that\'s filled with almonds. share that serving of onion rings, or take a slender slice of pecan pie instead of a slab. and remember to stop before you get too carried away-otherwise, you might just begin to feel that guilt coming your way after all. prep, less is more-more nutrients, that is. try to eat some raw vegetables and fruit every day, and when you\'re cooking, opt for steaming or a light stir-fry, so more vitamins and minerals will be retained. it\'s no secret that processed foods don\'t grow on trees-they\'re produced on an assembly line, where they not only pick up plenty of chemicals, fat, sugar, and salt, but lose a lot of nutritional value, too. so stick with nature\'s model when you can, and choose fresh roasted turkey breast over processed turkey, mac and cheese made with whole grain macaroni and natural cheese over that bright orange variety, fresh oatmeal made from rolled oats over the lower-fiber and super-sugary instant varieties. healthy eating begins at home. let\'s face it. it isn\'t easy to nibble on fresh fruit when your darling dearest is diving headfirst into a vat of ice cream-right next to you on the sofa. or to reach for a cheese stick when he\'s filled the cabinets with cheez doodles. so enlist him-and other family members-in making your home a healthy food zone. make whole grain your house bread, stock your freezer with frozen yogurt, and ban the unhealthy snacks you can\'t help attacking when they\'re within reach. and don\'t stop after delivery. healthy eating is linked not only with a better pregnancy outcome but with a lower risk of many diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. bad habits can sabotage a good diet. eating well

(rejoice, food lovers). but it\'s important to remember that one of the two is a tiny developing fetus whose caloric needs are significantly lower than mom\'s-a mere 300 on average a day, more or less (sorry, food lovers). so, on average, you now need only about 300 calories more a day than you used to eat prepregnancy- the equivalent of 2 glasses of skim milk and a bowl of oatmeal (not exactly the all-you-can-eat sundae bar you might have been envisioning). pretty easy to spend (or overspend), given the extra nutritional requirements of pregnancy. what\'s more, during the first trimester you probably don\'t need any extra calories at all (that baby you\'re growing is only pea size), unless you\'re trying to compensate for starting out underweight. by the time your metabolism speeds up during the second trimester, you can aim for 300 to 350 extra calories. later in pregnancy (when your baby is much bigger) you may even need more, or upward of about 500 extra calories a day. eating more calories than you and your baby need isn\'t only unnecessary, but it can lead to excessive weight gain. eating too few calories, on the other hand, is also unhealthy as pregnancy progresses. moms-to-be who don\'t take in enough calories during the second and third trimesters can slow the growth of their babies. there are 4 exceptions to this basic formula-and if any apply to you, it\'ll be important to ask your practitioner for input on your calorie input. if you\'re overweight, you can possibly do with fewer calories, as long as you have the right nutritional guidance (you\'ll have to focus even more on quality). if you\'re seriously underweight, you\'ll need more calories so you can catch up weight-wise. if you\'re a teen, you\'re still growing yourself, which means you have unique nutritional needs (though calories, again, may depend on whether you\'re underweight, overweight, or just about the right weight). and if you\'re carrying multiples, you\'ll have to add about 300 calories for each baby. but while calories count during pregnancy, they don\'t have to be literally counted. no need to add them up at every meal or keep a running log of what you ate when. how will you know if you\'re getting the right number of calories then? simple-just watch your weight gain. if your weight gain is right on target, you\'re eating the right number of calories. if you\'re gaining too little or too slowly, you\'re eating too few calories-and if you\'re gaining too much too fast, you\'re eating too many. just maintain or adjust your food intake as necessary, but be careful not to cut out nutrients you need along with calories- just be extra efficient in your eating. see page 177 for more on weight gain. protein foods: 3 servings daily. how does your baby grow? using, among other nutrients, the amino acids (the building blocks of human cells) from the protein you eat each day. because your baby\'s cells are multiplying rapidly, protein is an extremely vital component of your pregnancy diet. if the recommended 75 grams per day sounds like a lot, keep in mind that most americans (including you, most likely) consume at least that much daily without even trying, and those on high-protein diets pack away a lot more. when tallying your protein servings, don\'t forget to count the protein found in many high-calcium foods, like cheese and yogurt (especially greek), as well as in whole grains and legumes. every day aim to have 3 of the following (each is 1 protein serving, or about 25 grams of protein), or a combination equivalent to 3 servings. keep in mind that most of the dairy options also fill your calcium requirement, which make them especially efficient choices (see box, this page, for a list of plant proteins): 24 ounces

plenty of calcium for strong bones and teeth. well, so do growing fetuses on their way to becoming growing children. calcium is also vital for muscle, heart, and nerve development, blood clotting, and enzyme activity. but it\'s not only your baby who stands to lose when you don\'t get enough calcium. if incoming supplies aren\'t keeping up, your baby-making factory will tap into the calcium in your own bones to help meet its quota, setting you up for osteoporosis later in life-another good reason to bone up on calcium now. can\'t stomach the taste of milk by the glassful? luckily, calcium doesn\'t have to be served in glasses at all. it can be served up as a cup of yogurt or a piece of cheese. it can be enjoyed in smoothies, soups, casseroles, cereals, dips, sauces, desserts, and more. the lactose-intolerant can easily substitute lactose-free dairy products (milk, cottage cheese, and even ice cream come lactose-free). for those who don\'t eat dairy products at all, calcium also comes in nondairy form. a glass of calcium-fortified orange juice, for instance, efficiently provides a serving of calcium (along with a serving of vitamin c). a glass of calcium-fortified almond milk

reasons to go with the grain. whole grains are packed with nutrients, particularly the b vitamins (except for vitamin b12, found only in animal products) that are needed for just about every part of your baby\'s body. these concentrated complex carbohydrates are also rich in iron and trace minerals, such as zinc, selenium, and magnesium, all very important in pregnancy. an added plus: carbs can calm a queasy tummy and combat constipation. though these selections have many nutrients in common, each has its own strengths. to net the best benefits, include a variety of whole grains and legumes

that refined grains just don\'t stack up nutritionally. even if they\'re \"enriched,\" they are still lacking in fiber, protein, and more than a dozen vitamins and trace minerals that are found in the original whole grain. aim for about 6 from this list every day. don\'t forget that many also contribute to your protein intake, often significantly: 1 slice whole wheat, whole oat, brown rice, whole

iron are essential for the developing blood supply of your baby and for your own expanding blood supply, you\'ll need to pump up your iron intake during these 9 months. because it\'s often difficult to fill the pregnancy iron requirement through diet alone, your practitioner may recommend that you take a daily iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamins from the 20th week on, or whenever routine testing shows an iron shortfall. to enhance the absorption of the iron, take it between meals with a fruit juice rich in vitamin c (caffeinated beverages, antacids, high-fiber foods, and high-calcium foods can interfere with iron absorption). eat your iron-rich foods with a side of c, too. small amounts of iron are found in most of the fruits, vegetables, grains, and meats you eat every day. but try to have some of the following iron-rich foods daily. again, many iron-rich foods also fill other requirements at the same time: beef, buffalo, duck, turkey cooked clams, oysters, mussels, and shrimp sardines spinach, collard, kale, and turnip greens seaweed pumpkin seeds oat bran barley, bulgur, quinoa beans and peas edamame and soy products dried fruit fats and high-fat foods: about 4 serv- ings daily. now, here\'s a requirement that\'s not only easy to fill, but easy to overfill. and though there\'s no harm- and probably some benefit-in having a couple of extra green leafies or vitamin c foods, excess fat servings could spell excess pounds. still, though sensibly moderating your fat intake during pregnancy is a good idea, eliminating all fat from your expectant diet isn\'t. fat is vital to your developing baby. the essential fatty acids in them are just that-essential. especially beneficial in the third trimester are omega-3 fatty acids (see page 98). keep track of your fat intake-fill your daily quota but try not to overfill it. and in keeping track, don\'t forget that the fat used in cooking and preparing","title" : "white whole

you\'d be getting an a for willpower-but less vitamin a in your veggies. research shows that many of the nutrients found in vegetables aren\'t well absorbed by the body if not accompanied by a side of fat. so make a point of including a little fat with your veggies: enjoy oil with your stir-fry, a sprinkle of nuts on your broccoli, and dressing with your salad. foods counts, too: the butter you scrambled your eggs in, the mayo you tossed your coleslaw with. the good news is, adding some fat to the preparation of your veggies boosts your body\'s absorption of their nutrients (see box, page 97). if you\'re not gaining enough weight, and increasing your intake of other nutritious foods hasn\'t done the trick, try adding an extra fat serving each day-the concentrated calories it provides may help you hit your optimum weight-gain stride. if you\'re gaining too quickly, you can cut back by 1 or 2 servings-but again, don\'t cut fat out altogether. the foods on this list are made up completely (or mostly) of fat. they certainly won\'t be the only source of fat in your diet (full-fat cheeses and yogurts, some meats, and nuts and seeds are all high in fat), but these \"added fats\" are the only ones you\'ll want to keep track of. if your weight gain is on target, aim for about 4 full (about 14 grams each) or 8 half (about 7 grams each) fat servings each day. if it\'s not, consider adjusting your fat intake up or down: 1 tablespoon oil, such as vegetable, olive, canola, grapeseed, or sesame 1 tablespoon regular butter or margarine 1 tablespoon regular mayonnaise 2 tablespoons regular salad dressing 2 tablespoons heavy or whipping cream ¼ cup half-and-half ¼ cup whipped cream ¼ cup regular sour cream 2 tablespoons regular cream cheese 2 tablespoons peanut, almond, or other nut butter omega-3 fatty acids. are you fat pho- bic (especially since pregnancy put you on the weight-gain fast track)? fear not your fat-just choose the right ones. after all, not all fats are created equal. some fats are good ones-and they\'re especially good (make that great) when you\'re expecting. omega-3 fatty acids, most notably dha, are the best addition you can make to your diet when you\'re eating for two. that\'s because dha is essential for proper brain growth and eye development in fetuses and young babies. in fact, researchers have found that toddlers whose moms consumed plenty of dha during pregnancy had better hand-eye coordination than their peers, though it\'s unclear if this translates to boosted brainpower later in childhood. getting enough of this vital baby brain fuel in your diet is especially important during the last trimester (when your baby\'s brain grows at a phenomenal pace) and while you\'re nursing (the dha content of a baby\'s brain triples during the first 3 months of life). and what\'s good for the expected is also good for the expecting. for you, getting enough dha may mean moderated mood swings and a lowered risk of postpartum depression. another potential postpartum perk? getting enough dha when you\'re expecting could mean your baby will have better sleep habits later on. luckily, dha is found in plenty of foods you probably already eat-and like to eat: salmon (choose wild when you can) and other higher-fat fish, such as sardines canned light tuna walnuts arugula dha-rich eggs (often called omega-3 eggs) grass-fed beef and buffalo crab and shrimp chicken (free-range-or pasture-raised-chickens usually have more dha) you can also ask your practitioner about pregnancy-safe mercury-free dha supplements (many prenatal supplements contain up to 200 to 300 mg of dha already). not a fan of the fishy aftertaste some dha supplements leave behind (and that often repeat)? there are vegetarian and vegan alternatives that are fish-free. fluids: as much as you need. you\'re not only eating for two, but drinking for two. your baby\'s body, like yours, is composed mostly of fluids. as that little body grows, so does its demand for fluids. your body needs fluids more than ever, too, since pregnancy pumps up fluid volume significantly. water also eases constipation, rids your body of toxins and waste products (and baby\'s, too), and reduces excessive swelling and the risk of utis and preterm labor. so it\'s important you get enough fluids when you\'re expecting. but just how much is \"enough\"? you\'ve probably heard that everyone should get at least 8 glasses (or 64 ounces) a day, but there\'s really no scientific basis for that one-size-fits-all formula for fluid intake. how much fluid a person needs varies a lot-it depends on her activity level, where she lives, what she eats, her bmi, and a whole host of other variables (including whether or not she\'s pregnant). it can even vary from day to day (if","title" : "fat matters"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 16,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "t rying to shake the salt habit because you\'re afraid it\'ll lead to water retention and swelling? well, it may-but that\'s not such a bad thing when you\'re pregnant. in fact, some increase in body fluids in pregnancy (aka that swelling you\'re figuring isn\'t so swell) is necessary and normal, and a moderate amount of salt (sodium) is needed to maintain that extra fluid. seriously skimping on sodium can actually be harmful during pregnancy. still, most americans (including pregnant americans) consume far too much sodium. consuming very large quantities of salt and very salty foods frequently (such as those pickles you can\'t stop eating, extra soy sauce on your already-salty stir-fry, and super-salty potato chips by the bagful) isn\'t good for anyone, pregnant or not. high sodium intake is closely linked to high blood pressure, a condition that can cause complications in pregnancy, labor, and delivery. as a general rule, salt only lightly-or don\'t salt at all-during cooking. salt your food to taste at the table instead. have a pickle when you crave it, but try to stop at 1 or 2 instead of eating half the jar. and unless your practitioner recommends otherwise (because you are hyperthyroid, for example), use iodized salt to be sure you meet the increased need for iodine in pregnancy. in fact, be sure to check the label of the salt you\'re using to make sure it\'s got iodine in it (most sea salts, for example, don\'t contain iodine). about one-third of moms-to-be are iodine deficient-a problem when you\'re growing a baby, since iodine is needed for healthy brain development of the fetus. one day is spent at a sunny beach and the next at an air-conditioned mall, or one day is active and one is sedentary). fortunately, your body is likely to tell you how much fluid it needs-so listen. drink up whenever you\'re starting to feel thirsty, or preferably, before. reach for the water bottle, too, when you\'re sweating more than usual (such as when you\'re exercising or when it\'s hot outside), when you\'ve been vomiting, or if you\'re retaining a lot of fluid (paradoxically, extra fluids can flush out excess fluids). and the best gauge of your fluid intake: your fluid output. if your urine is pale straw colored and there\'s plenty of it, you\'re getting enough to drink. if it\'s dark yellow and scant, you need to drink more. of course, not all your fluids have to come from water. you get a good share of fluids from milk (which is two-thirds water), almond milk, coconut water, fruit and vegetable juices, and soups.","title" : "a grain of salt"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 17,"author" : "heidi

vary. chances are your practitioner will prescribe or recommend a supplement, which will take the guesswork (and homework) out of choosing a formula yourself. if you\'re facing the pharmacy shelves without a recommendation, look for a formula that contains: ■ no more than 4,000 iu (800 mcg) of vitamin a (amounts over 10,000 iu could be toxic). many manufacturers have reduced the amount of vitamin a in their vitamin supplements or have replaced it with beta-carotene, a much safer source of vitamin a. ■ at least 400 to 600 mcg of folic acid (folate) ■ 250 mg of calcium-though if you\'re not getting enough calcium in your diet, you will need to take an extra calcium supplement to reach the daily pregnancy quota for calcium of 1,200 mg. do not take more than 250 mg of calcium at the same time as supplementary iron, because calcium interferes with iron absorption. ■ 30 mg iron ■ 50 to 80 mg vitamin c ■ 15 mg zinc ■ 2 mg copper ■ 2 mg vitamin b6 ■ at least 400 iu of vitamin d ■ approximately the dri for vitamin e (15 mg), thiamin (1.4 mg), riboflavin (1.4 mg), niacin (18 mg), and vitamin b12 (2.6 mg). most prenatal supplements contain 2 to 3 times the dri of these. there are no known harmful effects from such doses. ■ 150 mcg of iodine (not all prenatals contain iodine or this amount of it) ■ some formulas may also contain mag- nesium, selenium, fluoride, biotin, choline, phosphorus, pantothenic acid, extra b6 (to combat queasiness), ginger (ditto), and/or baby brain- boosting dha. also important: scan for ingredients that shouldn\'t be in your prenatal supplement, such as herbs. when in doubt, ask your practitioner. fruit and vegetables count, too-especially juicy ones, like watermelon. prenatal vitamin supplements: a pregnancy formula taken daily. with all the nutrients already packed into the daily dozen (or any healthy diet), why would you need to add a prenatal vitamin to the mix? couldn\'t you fill all of your requirements by filling yourself with the right foods? well, you probably could-that is, if you lived in a laboratory where your food was precisely prepared and measured to calculate an adequate daily intake, and if you never ate on the run, had to work through lunch, or felt too sick to eat. in the real world-the one you most likely live in-a prenatal supplement provides extra health insurance for you and your baby, covering those nutritional bases when your diet doesn\'t. and that\'s why taking one daily is recommended. still, a supplement is just a supplement. no pill (or powder), no matter how complete, can replace a good diet. it\'s best if most of your vitamins and minerals come from foods, because that\'s the way nutrients can be most effectively used. fresh foods contain not only nutrients that we know about and can be synthesized in a pill, but probably lots of others that are as yet undiscovered. food also supplies fiber and water (fruits and vegetables are loaded with both) and important calories and protein, none of which comes efficiently packaged in a pill. but don\'t think that because a little is good, a lot is better. any vitamin or mineral supplementation beyond what\'s found in your prenatal should be taken only if your practitioner has recommended it-and the same goes for herbal supplements, too. as for vitamins and minerals you can get from your diet, you can\'t overdo the nutrients by piling up your plate at the salad bar-so no need to hold back when the carrots call or the broccoli beckons. what you may be wondering about milk-free diet \"i\'m lactose intolerant, and drinking 4 glasses of milk a day would make me feel really sick. but don\'t babies need milk?\" i t\'s not milk your baby needs, it\'s cal-cium. since milk is one of nature\'s finest and most convenient sources of calcium in the american diet, it\'s the one most often recommended for filling the greatly increased requirement during pregnancy. but if milk leaves you with more than a sour taste in your mouth and a white mustache above your lips (got gas?), you probably think twice before reaching for that glass of the white stuff. fortunately, you don\'t have to suffer so your baby can grow healthy teeth and bones. if you\'re lactose intolerant or just don\'t have a taste for milk, plenty of substitutes are available that fill the nutritional bill just as well. even if regular milk turns your tummy, you can easily turn to lactose-free varieties (ditto other lactose-free dairy). you may find that your tummy tolerates hard cheeses and fully processed yogurts (the active cultures in them actually help your digestion), as well as dairy products made from pasteurized goat\'s or sheep\'s milk. another advantage of using lactose-free milk products: some are fortified with extra calcium (check labels and choose one that is). taking a lactase tablet before ingesting regular milk or milk products, or adding lactase drops to regular milk, can also minimize or eliminate dairy-induced tummy troubles. even if you\'ve been lactose intolerant for years, you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that your tummy no longer puts up a fuss in the second and third trimester, conveniently when baby\'s needs for calcium are greatest. if so, go ahead and indulge in dairy- just keep in mind that your tummy may have its limits, so keep those lactose-free options open, too. also remember, your free pass to the dairy case will probably expire once baby arrives. if you can\'t handle any dairy products or are allergic to them, you can still get all the calcium your baby requires by drinking calcium-fortified juices or almond milk and eating the nondairy foods listed under calcium foods on page 93. if your problem with milk isn\'t physiological but just a matter of taste, try some of the dairy or nondairy calcium-rich alternatives. there are bound to be plenty that your taste buds can embrace. or disguise your milk in cereal, soups, and smoothies.","title" :

pasteurization was the greatest thing to happen to dairy products since cows. and it still is, particularly as far as pregnant women are concerned. to protect yourself and your baby from harmful bacteria, make sure all the milk you drink is pasteurized and all the dairy products you eat are made from pasteurized milk (\"raw\" dairy is not pasteurized). be especially careful when it comes to soft cheeses (fresh mozzarella, feta, brie, blue cheese, soft mexican-style cheese) made from raw milk, since these can be contaminated with listeria, a particularly dangerous bacteria (see page 118). choose pasteurized varieties of these cheeses (domestic is more likely to be pasteurized than imported, but always check the label) or heat until bubbly before eating. keep in mind that the raw rage has expanded the number of non-pasteurized products on the market, so pregnant buyer be wary. and dairy doesn\'t corner the market when it comes to pasteurization. eggs come pasteurized, too (eliminating the risk of salmonella)-a good choice if you\'re whipping up a homemade caesar dressing or prefer your yolks runny or your scrambles soft. juices you drink should also be pasteurized (to eliminate e. coli and other harmful bacteria). most (but not all) commercially packaged juice is pasteurized, so always check the label before you buy. not sure if a juice is pasteurized or pretty sure it isn\'t (say, freshly squeezed at the juice bar)? don\'t drink it. ditto for smoothies made with juice, unless you\'re sure it\'s pasteurized. fresh coconuts cut open right in front of you and served with a straw are fine to drink since the coconut water is sterile and well protected inside the hard coconut shell. wondering about \"flash-pasteurized\"? it\'s a faster but just as effective pasteurization process, which kills bacteria while preserving flavor. and how about juicing you do at home? that\'s all good (and yummy, and nutritious)-as long as you\'ve thoroughly washed the produce first. if you can\'t seem to get enough calcium into your diet, ask your practitioner to recommend a calcium supplement (there are plenty of chewable varieties that are sweet revenge for those who find a pill hard to swallow). you\'ll also need to be sure that you\'re getting enough vitamin d (which is added to cow\'s milk). many calcium supplements include vitamin d (which actually boosts

flaxseed products, for example-touted for their health benefits, of which they have many. some practitioners recommend limiting how much flax expectant moms consume (in oil, seed, or supplement form), citing animal studies that show that very large amounts may affect a baby\'s development-though there\'s no clear evidence that the same would hold true for human moms and babies. other practitioners say moderate amounts of flax are fine during pregnancy-especially because it\'s a good source of baby-friendly omega-3 fatty acids. unsure whether to reach for the flax? ask your practitioner for his or her recommendation. what about other health food favorites? hemp seed, hemp food products, and hemp seed oil in moderation (1 to 2 servings a day) are probably safe for expectant moms-and a good source of protein, fiber, and fatty acids. but since hemp\'s use during pregnancy has not been well studied, it makes sense to avoid it in large concentrations (as it would be in supplement form). chia seeds are an excellent source of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, calcium, and iron-but while a sprinkle on a salad, yogurt, or cereal, or in a smoothie is likely a safe and nutritious bet, check in with your practitioner before you chow down on chia because (surprise!) its safety hasn\'t been studied in pregnancy. the pregnancy safety of spiru-lina (a natural algae powder that is high in protein and calcium and is a good source of antioxidants, b vitamins, and other nutrients) also hasn\'t been established, leading some practitioners to suggest that moms-to-be limit or even avoid using this nutrient-packed powder. another reason to consider pausing when pregnant before using spirulina: it\'s sometimes contaminated with toxins, including heavy metals, as well as harmful bacteria. same goes for popular \"green food\" powders, some of which also contain herbs and supplements that might not be pregnancy safe. wheat grass doesn\'t get a pass, either- not only because there\'s no proof that it\'s safe during pregnancy, but also because it, too, can be contaminated with bacteria. thinking about shaking things up with a protein shake mix? think about running the

foodie can\'t). a good compromise when you\'re expecting? dig into those raw veggies, serve those salads, and by all means eat that apple (and fresh peach, and fresh mango) a day-but also remember

the best time for your baby to arrive is when he or she is ready. when an elective delivery is planned, there\'s the possibility that baby will inadvertently be born too soon (particularly if the dates are off to begin with). another potential perk for your baby if you elect to let labor take its course (or try vbac instead of scheduling a repeat cesarean delivery): there\'s evidence to suggest that babies who have gone through at least some labor have fewer health problems than those who never did-even if mom ultimately ends up with a medically necessary c-section. strep, the kind

who will be carrying gbs at the time of delivery). some hospitals and birthing centers offer a rapid gbs test that can screen women during labor and provide results within the hour, taking the place of the screen routinely done between weeks 35 and 37. ask your practitioner if that\'s an option at the facility where you\'ll be delivering.","title" : "elective cesareans"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

due to a metabolic disorder. though most of these conditions are very rare, they can be life-threatening if they go undetected and untreated. testing for these and other metabolic disorders is inexpensive, and in the very unlikely event that your baby tests positive for any of them, the pediatrician can verify the results and begin treatment immediately-which can make a tremendous difference in the prognosis. luckily, there are ways to screen for such metabolic disorders. drops of blood, taken routinely from an infant\'s heel after birth, are used to test for 21 (or more) serious genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and functional disorders, including pku, hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, bio-tinidase deficiency, maple syrup urine disease, galactosemia, homocystinuria, medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency, and sickle cell anemia. all 50 states and the district of columbia require newborn screening for at least 21 disorders, and more than half of all states screen newborns for all 29 disorders for which the american college of medical genetics (acmg) recommends testing. check with your practitioner or your local board of health to find out what tests are done in your state. you can also look up your state\'s requirements at the national newborn screening & genetics resource center\'s (nnsgrc) website: genes-r-us.uthscsa.edu. if your hospital doesn\'t automatically provide all 29 tests, you can arrange to have them done. for more information about newborn screening, check with the march of dimes: marchofdimes.com. the cdc also recommends, and some states require, screening tests soon after birth for congenital heart disease (chd). this condition, which affects 1 in 100 babies, can lead to disability or death if not caught and treated early. happily, when a baby gets a diagnosis early and is treated early, those risks are reduced significantly-and in most cases, completely. screening for chd is simple and painless: a sensor is placed on your baby\'s skin to measure your little one\'s pulse and the amount of oxygen in his or her blood. if the results of the screening test seem questionable, the doctor will be able to do further testing (echocardiogram-an ultrasound of the heart, for instance) to determine if anything is wrong. if your state doesn\'t require the test, ask the pediatrician if it could be given to your baby anyway. how\'s the test done? it\'s performed using vaginal and rectal swabs. if you test positive (meaning you\'re a carrier), you\'ll be given iv antibiotics during labor-and this treatment virtually eliminates any risk to your baby. (gbs can also show up in a urine culture obtained at a prenatal checkup. if it does, it\'ll be treated right away with oral antibiotics and again in labor with iv antibiotics.) if your practitioner doesn\'t offer the gbs test during late pregnancy, you should request it. even if you weren\'t tested but end up in labor with certain risk factors that point to gbs (like preterm labor, a fever during labor, or water breaking more than 18 hours before delivery), your practitioner will just treat you with iv antibiotics to be sure you don\'t pass any infection you might have on to your baby. if you\'ve previously delivered a baby with gbs, your practitioner may also skip the test and proceed straight to treatment during labor. playing it safe through testing- and, if necessary, treatment-means that your baby will be protected from a gbs infection. and that\'s a very good thing.","title" : "lifesaving screenings for newborns"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 31,"author" : "heidi

giving birth (called placentophagy) may not sound particularly appetizing, but it\'s an option more moms are putting in their birth plans. and maybe you\'re wondering whether you should order it up, too. the placenta, the incredible organ that nourished and nurtured your baby during his or her 9-month stay in your uterine home, is usually just discarded after delivery. but proponents of placentophagy say that tossing your placenta is a waste-that consuming it instead can raise your energy levels, ward off anemia, give your milk supply a boost, balance hormones, and lower your chances of postpartum depression. not game to gobble up your placenta, say, in a smoothie? not to worry-few new moms do. the most common way to eat your placenta-and undoubtedly the easiest to swallow-is in pill form. in a process called placenta encapsulation, your placenta is dried, powdered, and sealed into vitamin-size capsules (there are companies who will do it for you), but it comes at a price. some moms opt to do it themselves at home, for free (diy kits-or instructions-are available online). the placenta can also be distilled into an alcohol-based solution for you to take in drop form in your smoothies or other drinks. there are no clinical trials or scientific research to back the effectiveness of these placenta preparations, and most medical experts are skeptical about the perks of eating the afterbirth. they point out that the touted benefits may be the result of a placebo effect (if you expect to feel good after eating your placenta, you\'ll probably feel that way)-and also point to women who end up sick after they\'ve popped placenta pills or snacked on placenta. another major potential downside to downing placenta, according to experts: there\'s the very real possibility of spreading infection when you\'re handling a raw, blood-filled organ, easily contaminated by bacteria. if you\'re considering using your placenta after delivery, be sure to find out if the hospital or birthing center you\'re delivering in will allow you to pack it up and take it home (or send it off for processing). not all will. of course, you won\'t have to contend with hospital protocols if you\'re delivering at home. you or discourage you from hitting the road-or the rails or the skies-at this point in your pregnancy will probably depend on that point of view, as well as on several other factors. most important is the kind of pregnancy you\'ve been having: you\'re more likely to get the green light if yours has been uncomplicated. how far along you are (most practitioners advise against flying after the 36th week) and whether you are at any increased risk at all for premature labor will weigh into the recommendation, too. also very important is how you\'ve been feeling. pregnancy symptoms that multiply as the months pass also tend to multiply as the miles pass, and traveling can lead to increased backache, aggravate varicose veins and hemorrhoids (if you\'ll be sitting in a cramped airplane seat), and restrict circulation, increasing the risk of a blood clot. other considerations include how far and for how long you will be traveling (and how long you will actually be in transit), how physically demanding the trip will be, and how necessary the trip is (optional trips or trips that can be easily postponed may not be worth making now). if you\'re traveling by air, you\'ll also need to factor in any restrictions of the airline you choose. some will not let you travel in the last month or two without a letter from your practitioner stating that you\'re not going into labor imminently (as in, during the flight). others offer more wiggle room (if not seat or leg room). and some may practice an unofficial don\'t-ask-don\'t-tell policy (after all, it\'s hard to judge how pregnant a woman is just from a glance at the check-in desk). if your practitioner gives you the go-ahead, there are still plenty of other arrangements you\'ll need to make besides the travel ones. see page 268 for tips to ensure happy (and safer and more comfortable) travels for the pregnant you. getting plenty of rest and staying well hydrated will be especially key. but most important on your to-do list will be making sure you have the name, phone number, and address of a recommended practitioner (and the hospital or birthing center where he or she delivers) at your destination-one, of course, whose services will be covered by your insurance plan should you end up requiring them. if you\'re traveling a long distance, you may also want to consider the possibility of bringing along your partner on the remote chance that if you do end up going into labor at your destination, at least you won\'t have to deliver without him. and you might want to look into travel insurance, just in case an unexpected complication forces you to cancel your trip.","title" : "popping placenta"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 35,"author" :

weather the storm (perhaps literally) of any disaster. some things to think about: ■ have a communication plan. landlines can go out and wireless networks can become overloaded during a disaster, making it impossible to reach your partner and other family by phone. plan ahead to text and use social networks and messaging apps you share with family to get in touch during and after a disaster. ■ have a plan for medical emergencies and emergency delivery (see page 400 for a how-to). talk to your practitioner now about emergency options in case you go into labor or are having bleeding or other symptoms of a complication when phone lines are down, the practitioner\'s office isn\'t open, or you can\'t get to the hospital. and be sure you have a copy of your electronic health record handy in case you find yourself with an unfamiliar care provider in an emergency. ■ prepare an emergency kit and bag. experts recommend having an emergency kit with at least 3 days\' worth of non-perishable food on hand (think nuts, freeze-dried fruit, whole grain crackers, peanut butter, granola bars, and canned goods with pull tabs, water (at least 1 gallon per person or pet for 3 days), prenatal vitamins, prescription medication, external cell phone batteries, a battery operated radio, a blanket, a first aid kit, flashlight, extra batteries, hand sanitizer, and other things you may need). have an emergency kit in your car, too. visit ready.gov for more tips. remember, too, how important it will be to take care of your baby and yourself during a disaster-to eat regularly, stay hydrated, and get the rest you need, as hard as those might be to do in such a stressful situation. and speaking of stress, try to make sure it doesn\'t overwhelm you-especially since extreme stress is sometimes linked to preterm labor. tap in to the relaxation techniques you\'re using to stay calm during pregnancy (and if you\'re not using them already, prepping for just-in-case is another good reason to start). some numbers to keep handy, if disaster does strike (and outside help is reachable): the national disaster distress helpline, 1-800-985-5990, or text talkwithus to 66746. you can

evenings to yourselves, rendezvous for a romantic candlelit dinner or a moonlit stroll. cuddle while you watch tv, or soap each other in the shower. or use massage as the medium. or do everything but what\'s on your no-fly list (get a list of restrictions from your practitioner). this may not quite satisfy like the real thing, but try to remember you have a whole lifetime of lovemaking

it sounds like you\'ve glimpsed it already. and that\'s actually a really good thing. when baby makes three, your twosome is bound to undergo some shifting of dynamics and reshuffling of priorities. but this predictable upheaval is usually less stressful-and easier to adapt to- when a couple begins the natural and inevitable evolution of their relationship during pregnancy. in other words, the changes to your relationship are more likely to represent a change for the better if they begin before baby\'s arrival. couples who don\'t anticipate at least some disruption of romance-as-usual- who

yourselves into nurture mode, don\'t forget that baby won\'t be the only one who\'ll need nurturing. as normal-and healthy-as it is to be wrapped up in your expected extra special delivery, it\'s also important to reserve some emotional energy for the relationship that created that bundle of joy in the first place. now is the time to learn to combine the care and feeding of your baby with the care and feeding of your twosome. while you\'re busily feathering your nest, make the effort to regularly reinforce romance. hug early and often each day. hold hands while you\'re browsing for last-minute

moons). bring massage oil to bed now and then. even if you\'re not in the mood for sex-or it\'s seeming too much like hard work these days-any kind of touching can keep you close, while reminding you both that there\'s more to life than lamaze and layettes. keeping this very important thought in mind now will make it easier to keep the love light burning later when you\'re taking turns walking the

meal for just-born calves, your human breast milk is the perfect meal for your human newborn. here are the reasons why: it\'s custom made. tailored to meet the nutritional needs of human infants, breast milk contains at least 100 ingredients that aren\'t found in cow\'s milk and that can\'t be precisely replicated in commercial formulas. and unlike formula, the composition of breast milk changes constantly to meet a baby\'s ever-changing needs: it\'s different in the morning than it is in the late afternoon, different at the beginning of a feeding than at the end, different the 1st month than the 7th, and different for a preemie than for a full-term newborn. it even tastes different, depending on what you\'ve been snacking on (like your amniotic fluid does when you\'re pregnant). a one-of-a-kind food for your one-of-a-kind baby. it\'s easy to digest. breast milk is designed for a new baby\'s brand new digestive system. the protein and fat in breast milk are easier to digest than those in formula, and its important micronutrients are more easily absorbed. it\'s a tummy soother. breastfed babies are almost never constipated, thanks to the easier digestibility of breast milk. they also rarely have diarrhea, since breast milk appears to reduce the risk of digestive upset both by destroying harmful microorganisms and by encouraging the growth of beneficial ones. you know the much-touted pre-and probiotics that are added to some formulas? they\'re naturally occurring in breast milk. it doesn\'t make a stink. on a purely aesthetic note, the poops of a breastfed baby are sweeter smelling (at least until solids are introduced). it\'s an infection preventer. with each and every feeding, nursers get a healthy dose of antibodies to boost their immunity to bugs of all varieties (which is why breastfeeding is sometimes referred to as a baby\'s first immunization). in general, breastfed babies come down with fewer colds, ear infections, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and other illnesses than formula-fed infants, and when they do get sick, they\'ll usually recover more quickly and with fewer complications. breastfeeding also improves the immune response to vaccines for most diseases (such as tetanus, diphtheria, and polio). plus, it may offer some protection against sudden infant death syndrome (sids). it\'s a fat flattener. breastfed infants are less likely to be too chubby. that is, in part, because breastfeeding lets baby\'s appetite call the shots (and the ounces). a breastfed baby is likely to stop feeding when full, while a bottle-fed infant may be urged to keep feeding until the bottle\'s emptied. what\'s more, breast milk is actually ingeniously calorie controlled. the lower calorie foremilk (served up at the start of a feed) is designed as a thirst-quencher. the higher calorie hindmilk (served up at the end of a feed) is a filler-upper, signaling to a nurser that it\'s quitting time. and research suggests that the fat-defeating benefits of breastfeeding follow a baby out of the nursery-and into high school. studies show that former breastfeeders are less likely to battle weight as teens-and the longer they were breastfed, the lower their risk of becoming overweight. another potential long-term health plus for nursers: breastfeeding is linked to lower cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure later in life. it keeps allergies on hold. babies are almost never truly allergic to breast milk (though occasionally an infant may be sensitive to something mom has eaten). the formula flip side? more than 10 percent of babies turn out to be allergic to cow\'s milk formula (a switch to a soy or hydrolysate formula usually solves the problem but isn\'t ideal, since those stray even further in composition from the gold standard formula: breast milk). and there\'s more good news on the allergy front-evidence that breast-fed babies may be less likely to develop asthma and eczema. it\'s a brain booster. breastfeeding, according to some evidence, appears to slightly increase a child\'s iq, at least through age 15, and possibly beyond. this may be related not only to the brain-building fatty acids (dha) in breast milk, but also to the closeness and mother-baby interaction that is built into breastfeeding, which is believed to nurture a newborn\'s intellectual development.","title" : "why breast is best"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 40,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "luckily, nature has worked out all the mechanics, so there\'s not much you\'ll need to do to get your breasts ready to feed your baby. some lactation experts recommend that during the last months of pregnancy you skip the soap on your nipples and areolas-just rinse with water, instead. soap can dry the nipples, which may lead to cracking and soreness early in breastfeed-ing. if your nipples are dry, you can apply a lanolin-based cream such as lansinoh-otherwise, it\'s not necessary. the no-prep rule applies even to women with small or flat nipples. flat nipples don\'t need to be prepped for nursing with breast shells, hand manipulation, or a manual breast pump during pregnancy. not only are these prepping techniques often less effective than no treatment, but they can do more harm than good. the shells, besides being uncomfortably bulky, can cause sweating and rashes. hand manipulation and ahead-of-time pumping can stimulate contractions and, occasionally, even trigger breast infection. it\'s safe. you can be sure that the milk served up from your breasts is always prepared perfectly-and never spoiled, contaminated, expired, or recalled. it\'s made for suckers. it takes longer to drain a breast than a bottle, giving newborns more of the comforting sucking satisfaction they crave. plus, a breastfed baby can continue to comfort-suck on a nearly empty breast-something an empty bottle doesn\'t allow. it builds stronger mouths. mama\'s nipples and baby\'s mouth are made for each other-a naturally perfect match. even the most scientifically designed bottle nipple can\'t match up to a breast nipple, which gives a baby\'s jaws, gums, teeth, and palate the ultimate workout-a workout that ensures optimum oral development and some perks for baby\'s future teeth (like better alignment). another mouth perk to breast-feeding: babies who are breastfed are less likely to get cavities later on. it expands the taste buds early on. want to raise an adventurous eater? start at the breast. developing those little taste buds on breast milk, which takes on the flavor of whatever you\'ve been eating, may acclimate a baby early on to a world of flavors. researchers have found that nursed babies are less likely to be timid in their tastes than their formula-fed peers once they graduate to the high chair-which means they may be more likely to open wide to that spoonful of yams (or that forkful of curried chicken) later on. breastfeeding offers a pile of perks for mom (and dad), too: convenience. breast milk is the ultimate convenience food-always in stock, ready to serve, and consistently dispensed at the perfect temperature. it\'s fast food, too: no formula to run out of, shop for, or lug around, no bottles to clean or refill, no powders to mix, no meals to warm (say, when you\'re on a conference call and baby\'s wailing in the background). wherever you are-in bed, on the road, at the mall, on the beach-all the nourishment your baby needs is always on tap, no muss (or mess), no fuss. and if you and your baby aren\'t in the

whether mom sticks with breastfeed-ing (and the longer she sticks with it, the more health benefits for both her and baby). in fact, researchers have found that when dads are supportive of breast-feeding, moms are likely to give it a try 96 percent of the time. when dads are ambivalent, only about 26 percent give it a try. so take your influence seriously. read up on breastfeeding, take a class together, talk to other dads whose partners have breastfed, and ask whether a lactation consultant (basically, a nursing coach) will be available at the hospital or birthing center when baby\'s ready to chow down for the first time. (lesson one: it\'s a natural process, but it doesn\'t always come naturally.) if your partner is hesitant to ask for help-or she\'s just too tired after delivery-be her breast-feeding advocate and make sure she gets it. help get your spouse started, cheer her on, and then sit back and watch in wonder as those amazing breasts of hers take on one of life\'s most important (and incredibly special) jobs: baby feeding. sure, it takes only two to breastfeed, but it often takes three to make it happen. your baby may suppress ovulation (and your period) for several months. is this a birth control bet you should take, without a backup? probably not, unless back-to-back pregnancies are your objective (see page 27 for more). health benefits for mom. plenty of perks here: women who breastfeed have a slightly lower risk of developing uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and premenopausal breast cancer. they\'re also less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis than women who don\'t breastfeed. another benefit for breastfeeding moms: research suggests that women who breastfeed are somewhat less likely to suffer from postpartum depression (though ppd can strike a breastfeeding mom and can also strike a mom after she weans, as hormones fluctuate once again). nighttime feeds that are a (relative) breeze. have a hungry baby at 2 a.m.? you will. and when you do, you\'ll appreciate how fast you\'ll be able to feed that baby if you\'re breastfeeding. no stumbling to the kitchen to prepare a bottle in the dark. just pop a warm breast into that warm little mouth. eventually, easy multitasking. sure, nursing your newborn will take both arms and a lot of focus at first. but once you and baby become nursing pros, you\'ll be able to do just about anything else at the same time-from eating dinner to playing with your toddler. built-in bonding. the benefit of breast-feeding you\'re likely to appreciate most is the bond it nurtures between you and your little one. there\'s skin-to-skin and eye-to-eye contact, and the opportunity to cuddle and coo built right into every feed. true, bottle-feeding mamas (and daddies) can get just as close to their babies-but it takes a more conscious effort (there\'s always the understandable temptation to prop a bottle when you\'re busy or hand off feedings when you\'re tired).","title" : "when father knows

had and how it was performed. here\'s an overview: if you\'ve had a breast reduction or lumpectomy, you\'ll probably still be able to breastfeed, but you may not produce enough milk to nurse exclusively. check with your surgeon to see if care was taken to preserve milk ducts and nerve pathways during the procedure- if so, chances are good that you\'ll be able to produce at least some milk. if you\'ve had breast augmentation, your chances of being able to breastfeed successfully are good, since augmentation is less likely to interfere with breastfeeding than a breast reduction. still, it will depend on the technique, the incision, and the reason why it was done. while many women with implants are able to nurse exclusively, a significant minority may not produce enough milk.

weighing somewhere around 6 pounds and measuring anywhere from 18 to 19 inches tall, your baby is almost ready to be served up into your arms. right now, most of baby\'s systems (from circulatory to musculoskeletal) are just about equipped for life on the outside. though the digestive system is ready to roll, too, it hasn\'t really gotten a workout yet. remember, up until this point, your baby\'s nutrition has been arriving via the umbilical cord-no digestion necessary. but that\'s soon to change. as soon as baby takes his or her first suckle at your breast (or suck from the bottle), that digestive system will be jump-started-and those diapers will start filling. week 37 here\'s some exciting news: if your baby were born this week, he or she would be considered full term. mind you, that doesn\'t mean baby is finished growing-or getting ready for life on the outside. still gaining weight at about half a pound a week, the average fetus this age weighs about 6½ pounds (though size varies quite a bit from fetus to fetus, as it does from newborn to newborn). fat continues to accumulate on your baby, forming kissable dimples in those cute elbows, knees, and shoulders, and adorable creases and folds in the neck and wrists. to keep busy until the big debut, your baby is practicing to make perfect: inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid (to get the lungs ready for that first breath), sucking on his or her thumb (to prepare for that first suckle), blinking, and pivoting from side to side (which explains why yesterday you felt that sweet little butt on the left side and today it\'s taken a turn to the right). week 38 hitting the growth charts at about 7 pounds and the 20-inch mark (give or take an inch or two), your little one isn\'t so little anymore. in fact, baby\'s big enough for the big time-and the big day. with only 2 (or 4, max) weeks left in utero, all systems are almost go. to finish getting ready for his or her close-up (and all those photo ops), baby has a few last-minute details to take care of, like shedding the vernix (the greasy white substance protecting that tender new skin) and lanugo (the fine downy hair that covered your cutie\'s body for warmth). baby\'s also producing more surfactant, which will prevent the air sacs in the lungs from sticking to each other when breathing begins. your little one will be here before you know it! week 39 not much to report this week, at least in the height and weight department. fortunately for you and your overstretched skin (and aching back), baby\'s growth has slowed down-or even taken a hiatus until after delivery. on average, a baby this week still weighs in at between 7 and 8 pounds (the size of . . . a baby!) and measures 19 to 21 inches (though yours may be a little bigger or smaller). still, progress is being made in some other areas, especially baby\'s brain, which is growing and developing up a storm (at a rapid pace that will continue during the first 3 years of life). what\'s more, your baby\'s pink skin has turned whitish or whitish-grayish (no matter what skin your baby will ultimately be in, since pigmentation doesn\'t occur until soon after birth). a development that you may have noticed by now if this is your first pregnancy: baby\'s head might have dropped into your pelvis. this change of baby\'s locale might make for easier breathing (and less heartburn), but could also make it harder for you to walk (make that, waddle). week 40 congratulations! you\'ve reached the official end of your pregnancy (and maybe the end of your rope). for the record, your baby is fully full term and could weigh in anywhere between the 6- and 9-pound mark and measure anywhere from 19 to 22 inches, though some perfectly healthy babies check in slightly smaller or bigger than that. you may notice when your baby emerges that he or she (and you\'ll know for sure which at that momentous moment) is still curled into the fetal position, even though the fetal days are over. that\'s just sheer force of your baby, month 9 habit (after spending 9 months in the cramped confines of your uterus, your baby doesn\'t yet realize there\'s room to spread out now) and comfort (that snug-as-a-bug position feels good). when you do meet your new arrival, be sure to say hello-and more. though it\'s your first face-to-face, your baby will recognize the sound of your voice-and that of dad\'s. and if baby doesn\'t arrive on time (choosing to ignore the due date on your app), you\'re in good-if impatient-company. about 30 percent of all pregnancies proceed past the 40-week mark, though (thankfully) your practitioner will probably not let yours continue beyond 42 weeks. weeks 41-42 so, looks like baby has opted for a late checkout. fewer than 5 percent of babies are born on their actual due date-and around 10 percent decide to overstay their welcome in hotel uterus beyond week 41, thriving well into the 10th month (though you may have lost that \"thriving\" feeling long ago). remember, too, that most of the time an overdue baby isn\'t overdue at all-it\'s just that the due date was off. less often, a baby may be truly postmature. when a postmature baby does make a debut, it\'s often with dry, cracked, peeling, loose, and wrinkled skin (all completely temporary-soft new baby skin is soon to follow). that\'s because the protective vernix was shed weeks before, in anticipation of a delivery date that\'s since come and gone. an \"older\" fetus will also have longer nails, possibly longer hair, and definitely little or none of that baby fuzz (lanugo) at all. in general, postmature newborns tend to be more alert and open-eyed (after all, they\'re older and wiser). just to be sure all is well, your practitioner will likely monitor your overdue baby closely through nonstress tests and checks of the amniotic fluid or biophysical profiles.","title" : "your baby this month"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 49,"author" : "heidi

nothing to be concerned about. why does it happen? your breasts have been going through a lot in the last almost 9 months as they prepare for the all-important job of feeding your baby-including a lot of expansion and a lot of increased blood flow. maybe the blood is just the very normal response to the increasing blood supply in your breasts-or it\'s coming from a capillary that burst as your breasts inflated their way through the cup alphabet. or it could be a milk duct that\'s swollen thanks to pregnancy hormones. or maybe it\'s a papilloma (a small benign lump) in a milk duct that\'s been irritated. or your nipples could just be really raw (especially if you\'ve been tweaking them a lot to see if colostrum appears, or in an effort to get labor started). mention the bleeding to your practitioner. to be on the safe side (always the best side to be on), as well as to put your mind at ease, he or she may suggest that you have a breast ultrasound and exam done now and a

the time, such so-called lactating blood goes away after delivery. if it doesn\'t, still no worries-you can breastfeed even if you\'re lactating blood. the small amount of blood your baby will ingest along with the breast milk won\'t be harmful. if you are leaking colostrum, it\'s probably just a few drops. but if you\'re leaking more than that, you may want to consider wearing nursing pads in

40-week mark. that\'s because 40 weeks is the optimum uterine stay for babies. those who stick around much longer can face potential challenges (becoming too big to arrive vaginally, experiencing a decline in their placenta\'s function, or a dip in amniotic fluid levels). luckily, your practitioner can tap into plenty of tests and assessments of fetal wellbeing to make sure all\'s well and will end well . . . eventually: kick counts. your record of fetal movements (see page 315) can provide some indication of how your baby is doing. ten movements in an hour or 2 is usually reassuring. if you don\'t notice enough activity, other tests are then performed. the nonstress test (nst). you\'ll be hooked up to a fetal monitor (the same kind that\'s used during labor) in your practitioner\'s office to measure the baby\'s heart rate and response to movement. you will be holding a clicker (like a buzzer on jeopardy!), and each time you feel the baby move, you\'ll click. the monitoring goes on for 20 to 40 minutes and is able to detect if the fetus is under any stress. fetal acoustic stimulation (fas) or vibroacoustic stimulation (vas). does your baby need a little pick-me-up? if your little one isn\'t as active during a nonstress test as doctors would like, a sound-and-vibration-producing instrument will be placed on your tummy to give baby a little stimulus so your practitioner can more accurately measure that little heartbeat and those movements. the contraction stress test (cst) or oxytocin challenge test (oct). if the results of a nonstress test are unclear, your practitioner may order a stress test. this test, done at a hospital, tests how the baby responds to the \"stress\" of uterine contractions to get some idea of how he or she will handle full-blown labor. in this somewhat more complex and time-consuming test (it may take a number of hours), you\'re hooked up to a fetal monitor. if contractions are not happening on their own, you\'ll be given a low-dose iv of oxytocin (or you\'ll be asked to stimulate your nipples) to jump-start the contractions. how your baby responds to contractions indicates not your baby\'s head is engaged: first, he or she will do an internal exam to see whether the presenting part-ideally the head-is in the pelvis. second, he or she will feel that part externally (by pressing on your belly) to determine whether it is fixed in position or still \"floating\" free. how far the presenting part has progressed through the pelvis is measured in \"stations,\" each a centimeter long. a fully engaged baby is said to be at \"zero station\"-that is, the fetal head has descended to the level of the prominent bony landmarks on either side of the midpelvis. a baby who has just begun to descend may be at -4 or -5 station. once delivery begins, the head continues on through the pelvis past 0 to +1, +2, and so on, until it begins to \"crown\" at the external vaginal opening at +5. though an engaged head strongly suggests that the baby can get through the pelvis without difficulty, it\'s no guarantee. conversely, a fetus that is still free his or her condition and that of the placenta. this rough simulation of the conditions of labor can allow your practitioner to make a prediction about whether or not your baby can safely remain cocooned in your uterus and whether he or she can meet the strenuous demands of true labor. a biophysical profile (bpp). it\'s picture time, baby. using an ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitor, a bpp will look at five aspects of life in the uterus: findings from a nst, fetal breathing, fetal movement, fetal tone (the ability of your baby to flex and extend an arm or leg), and amniotic fluid volume. when all these are normal, your baby is probably doing fine. if any of

profile combines the nst with an evaluation of the quantity of amniotic fluid. a low level of amniotic fluid may indicate that a baby is not producing enough urine and the placenta may not be functioning up to par. if your baby reacts appropriately to the nonstress test and levels of amniotic fluid are adequate, it\'s likely that all is well. umbilical artery doppler velocim-etry. this test is performed when there is evidence of fetal growth lag and uses a special ultrasound to measure the flow of blood through the umbilical artery. a weak, absent, or reverse flow during the second half of the fetal cardiac cycle (when the heart is filling with blood rather than pumping it out) indicates the baby is not getting adequate nourishment and probably not growing well. other tests of fetal wellbeing. these include regular ultrasound exams to document fetal growth and fetal scalp stimulation (which tests how a fetus reacts to pressure on, or pinching of, the scalp) during an nst. most of the time, babies pass these tests with flying colors, which means they can continue to stay put until they\'re good and ready to make their debuts. rarely, the nst results can be labeled \"nonreactive.\" because these tests yield plenty of false positives, a nonreactive result doesn\'t definitely diagnose distress, but it will mean that your practitioner will continue to test your baby and, if it turns out there\'s any indication of fetal distress, will either induce your labor (see page 567) or perform a cesarean delivery. floating going into labor isn\'t necessarily going to have trouble negotiating the exit. and in fact, the majority of babies who haven\'t yet engaged when labor begins come through the pelvis smoothly. this is particularly true in moms who have already delivered 1 or more babies.","title" : "how is baby doing?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 60,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my baby used to kick so hard. i can still feel him moving, but he seems less active now.\" when you first heard from your baby, way back in the 5th month or so, there was ample room in the uterus for acrobatics, kickboxing, and punching. now that conditions are getting a little cramped, his gymnastics are curtailed. in this snug uterine straitjacket, there is little room for anything more than turning, twisting, and wiggling-which is probably what you\'ve been feeling. and once your baby\'s head is firmly engaged in your pelvis, he will be even more restricted in his movements. but this late in the game, it\'s not important what kind of fetal movement you feel (or even if it\'s only on one side), as long as you feel it. if, however, you feel no activity (see next question) or significantly diminished activity, check with your practitioner. \"i\'ve hardly felt the baby kick at all this afternoon. what does that mean?\" chances are your baby has settled down for a nap (older fetuses, like newborns, have periodic interludes of deep sleep) or that you\'ve been too busy or too active to notice any movements. for reassurance, check for activity using the test described on page 315. it\'s a good idea to repeat this test routinely twice a day throughout the last trimester. ten or more movements during each 1 to 2 hour test period (squirms and wriggles count, but not hiccups) mean that your baby\'s activity level is normal. fewer movements suggest that medical evaluation might be necessary to determine the cause of the inactivity, so put in a call to your practitioner if that\'s the case. though a baby who is relatively inactive in the womb can be perfectly healthy, inactivity at this point sometimes indicates fetal distress. picking up this distress early and taking steps to intervene can often prevent

sudden, harsh entrance into a cold, dry world. advocates of water birth say that allowing a baby to arrive in conditions that mimic those of the womb-warm and wet-can ease the transition and make that entry more peaceful, reducing a newborn\'s stress. if you choose to have a water birth, you\'ll not only spend your labor in a warm tub or pool, but you\'ll also deliver your newborn while you\'re still in the water (your baby will be pulled gently into the soothing water and then slowly lifted into your arms). your partner can be in the water with you during labor to support you and he can play catch (literally) with the baby during delivery. during labor, cold cloths, spray bottles, and plenty of water will keep you refreshed (as much as possible- you\'re having a baby, after all) while the midwife or other medical personnel monitors your baby\'s condition with an underwater doppler device. water births are really an option only for low-risk pregnancies, but they\'re available in more and more settings. most birthing centers and some hospitals offer the option of water births and most birthing centers have large tubs or jacuzzis in the birthing rooms (or portable birthing tubs on wheels that can be rolled into your room) that can also be used for soothing soaks or hydrotherapy, even if you ultimately decide against actually giving birth in water (or if it turns out not to be possible in your case). it\'s less likely that a hospital will have a tub large enough to accommodate a water birth, so if you prefer a water birth but are delivering in a hospital that doesn\'t offer the option or doesn\'t have tubs, ask whether it might be possible to bring your own birthing tub that you\'ve rented or purchased (see below). you can also choose to have a water birth at home-as long as you have your midwife\'s approval and the right equipment on hand. most home water birth tubs look like deep kiddie pools- they\'re inflatable, large enough to allow you to move around freely, deep enough so your pregnant belly can stay fully submerged, and have soft sides, allowing ■ arrangements for newborn screening (page 360) ■ the length of the hospital stay, bar- ring complications (page 468) of course, the most important feature of a good birth plan is flexibility. since childbirth-like most forces of nature-is unpredictable, the best-laid plans don\'t always go, well, according to plan. though chances are very good that your plan can be carried out just the way you drew it up, there\'s always the chance that it won\'t. there is no way to predict precisely how labor and delivery will progress (or not progress) until it gets underway-or how you\'ll really feel about those contractions once they get started. a birth plan you design ahead of time may not end up being medically advisable-or what works for you in the moment-and may have to be adjusted at the last minute for your baby\'s wellbe-ing and yours. a change of mind (yours) can also prompt a change of plan (you were dead set against having an epidural, but somewhere around 5 cm, you become dead set on having one). you to lean against (or over) the edges comfortably. you can purchase or rent a birthing tub online or from your midwife (some midwives loan out tubs at no cost-or you might also be able to borrow one from a friend who\'s been there, done that). if you\'re purchasing, expect to shell out a few hundred dollars for the tub and all the equipment that goes along with it, including liners, heater, filter, and tarp. on a tighter budget? you can also use your home\'s bathtub (assuming it\'s deep enough for your big belly and with enough room around the tub for your midwife to reach you during delivery or if an emergency arises). of course, you\'ll have to make sure it\'s cleaned and sterilized (with a water-bleach mixture) before the big day arrives. you\'ll also have to make sure you have a floating thermometer to monitor the water temperature and keep it stable at approximate body temperature (95°f to about 100°f, but no more than 101°f, because your body temperature could rise, causing the baby\'s heart rate to increase). birthing tubs come with heaters, so that\'s one less thing to worry about if you do end up using one. since a baby\'s breathing will not start until he or she comes out of the water and into the air (babies don\'t breathe in utero), drowning is not considered a risk of water births. for several reasons, however, a baby\'s underwater entry should be limited to no more than a few moments (10 seconds is the norm in the u.s.). first, because the umbilical cord can tear, cutting off the baby\'s oxygen lifeline unexpectedly. second, because once the placenta separates from the uterus-which can happen at any time after delivery-it can no longer provide the baby with sufficient oxygen. and finally, because the fluid your baby will be born into isn\'t sterile. remember, birth is a messy business. most women will poop when pushing (the midwife will scoop the feces out of the tub), and there will also be blood and urine in the water you\'re sitting in. if the baby aspirates (inhales) the fluid-unlikely except in the case of fetal stress during labor-he or she could be at risk of a serious infection. thinking you\'d like your baby to make an underwater appearance into the world? though it\'s a personal decision to make (like so many other birth decisions), it\'s one best made in consultation with your practitioner, so you can be sure it\'s a safe option for you and your baby. for more information on water births, go to waterbirth.org. bottom line: birth plans, though by no means necessary (you can definitely decide to go with the childbirth flow), are a great option, one that more and more expectant parents are taking advantage of. to figure out whether a birth plan is right for you and what should be in it, talk it over with your practitioner at your next visit.","title" : "water birth"}},"add" : {"doc" :

couples, not when it comes to labor and delivery. more and more are opting to share their birth experience with a doula, a woman trained as a labor companion. and for good reason. some studies have shown that women supported by doulas are less likely to require cesarean deliveries, induction, and pain relief. births attended by dou-las may also be shorter, with a lower rate of complications. the term \"doula\" comes from ancient greece, where it was used to describe the most important female servant in the household, the one who probably helped mom out the most during childbirth. what exactly can a doula do for you and your birth experience? that depends on the doula you choose, at what point in your pregnancy you hire her, and what your preferences are. some doulas become involved well before that first contraction strikes, helping with the design of a birth plan and easing prelabor jitters. many will come to the house to help a couple through early labor. once at the hospital or birthing center, the doula takes on a variety of responsibilities, again depending on your needs and wishes. typically, her primary role is as a continuous source of comfort, encouragement, and support (both emotional and physical) during labor. she\'ll serve as a soothing voice of experience (especially valuable if you\'re first-timers), help with relaxation techniques and breathing exercises, offer advice on labor positions, and do her share of massage, hand holding, pillow plumping, and bed adjusting. a doula can also act as a mediator and an advocate, ready to speak for you as needed, translate medical terms and explain procedures, and generally run interference with hospital personnel. she won\'t take the place of your coach (and a good doula won\'t make him feel like she\'s taking his place, either) or the nurse on duty-instead, she will augment their support and services (especially important if the nurse assigned to you has several other patients in labor at the same time or if labor is long and nurses come and go as shifts change). she will also likely be the only person (besides your coach) who will stay by your side throughout labor and delivery-a friendly and familiar face from start to finish. and many doulas don\'t stop there. they can also offer support and advice postpartum the tdap or td vaccine. that\'s because immunity from pertussis (and tetanus and diphtheria) wanes after several years. if you\'ve never been vaccinated against tetanus (either with the dtap series as a child or with td or tdap as an adult), you\'ll need to receive 2 doses of td early in pregnancy in addition to the regularly scheduled tdap in the third trimester. why the recommendation? it\'s to protect your baby when he or she is born. very young babies are vulnerable to pertussis (also called whooping cough), a contagious respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia and even death. until your baby is vaccinated against the disease with the full series of the dtap vaccine (the childhood version of the tdap, given beginning at 2 months), the antibodies that your body makes after receiving your tdap shot will be passed along to your little one, effectively protecting him or her from on everything from breastfeeding to baby care. though an expectant father may worry that hiring a doula will relegate him to third-wheel status, that isn\'t the case. a good doula is also there to help your coach relax so he can help you relax. she\'ll be there to answer questions he might not feel comfortable broaching with a doctor or nurse. she\'ll be there to provide an extra set of hands when you need your legs and back massaged at the same time, or when you need both a refill on ice chips and help breathing through a contraction. she\'ll be an obliging and cooperative member of your labor team-ready to pitch in, but not to push dad (or the medical team) aside and take over. and if dad\'s not in the picture, a doula can be an especially helpful helping hand by your side throughout the entire labor, delivery, and even postpartum period. how do you locate a doula? doulas don\'t need to be certified, but many birthing centers and hospitals keep lists of doulas, and so do some practitioners. ask friends who\'ve recently used a doula for recommendations, or check online for local doulas. once you\'ve tracked down a candidate, arrange a consultation before you hire her. ask her about her experience, her training, what she will do and what she won\'t do, what her philosophies are about childbirth (if you\'re planning on asking for an epidural, for instance, you won\'t want to hire a doula who discourages the use of pain relief), and whether she will be on call at all times and who covers for her if she isn\'t. ask whether she provides pregnancy and/ or postpartum services, and what her fees are-a consideration for many couples, since doulas aren\'t covered by insurance. some doulas offer discounts or even donate their services to those who can\'t afford their services or to military families (especially when the partner is deployed and won\'t be at the birth). for more information or to locate a doula in your area, contact doulas of north america at dona.org. an alternative to a doula is a female friend or relative who has gone through pregnancy and delivery herself and who you feel totally comfortable with. the plus: her services will definitely be free. the drawback: she probably won\'t be quite as knowledgeable. one way to remedy that is having a \"lay doula,\" a female friend who goes through 4 hours of training in doula techniques (ask if your hospital has such a training course). researchers have found that a lay doula can provide many of the same benefits as a professional one. the disease. and the studies back this up. research has found that when moms receive the recommended tdap booster during pregnancy, their babies are 50 percent less likely to catch pertussis than babies whose moms aren\'t vaccinated. and it\'s not just you who needs the vaccine. it\'s important that anyone else who will be in close contact with your newborn-baby\'s dad, baby\'s grandparents, the babysitter-get a booster, too. that way they won\'t contract the disease and spread it to baby, and your little one will be \"cocooned\" against pertussis. and here\'s some great news for busy moms-to-be: if the beginning of your third trimester (when you\'re scheduled for your tdap vaccine) coincides with flu season (when you\'ll need a flu shot) you won\'t have to schedule two appointments. research shows that it\'s completely safe to be vaccinated with both at the same time-making getting the vaccines you need to protect yourself and your baby-to-be a whole lot easier. speaking of vaccines, now\'s the perfect time to begin learning about all the vaccines your little one will be on the receiving end of during his or her first few years of life. there\'s no better or safer way to protect your precious bundle from preventable, sometimes life-threatening childhood diseases than by making sure he or she is vaccinated completely and on time, according to the recommended schedule. see what to expect the first year for more information about vaccines, their benefits, and their safety. a l l a b o u t:","title" : "doulas: best medicine for labor?"}},"add" :

"heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "here are the most commonly used labor and delivery pain medications: epidural. a full two-thirds of women delivering at hospitals choose to relieve their labor pain with an epidural. why do so many laboring moms request the epidural by name? for one, it\'s an extremely safe way to net good pain relief-only a small amount of medication is needed to achieve the desired effect, and the drug barely reaches the bloodstream (unlike general anesthesia or tranquilizers), meaning your baby isn\'t affected. for another, it\'s relatively easy to administer (it\'s injected directly into the epidural space, which is between the ligament that sheathes the vertebrae and the membrane that covers the spinal cord) and it\'s very patient friendly (you\'ll likely get that sweet relief within 10 to 15 minutes). the pain relief is local, focused on the lower part of the body (where the pain is the greatest), allowing you to be an active participant during childbirth and completely alert when it\'s time to greet your baby bundle. what\'s more, an epidural can be given to you as soon as you ask for one (and an anesthesiologist is available to administer it)-no need to wait until you\'re dilated a certain amount. happily, studies show that an early epidural doesn\'t increase the chances of a c-section. here\'s what you can expect if you\'re having an epidural: ■ first, an iv of fluids is started to pre- vent a drop in blood pressure. ■ in some hospitals (policies vary), a catheter (tube) is inserted into the bladder just before or just after the epidural is administered and stays in place to drain urine while the epidural is in effect (since you may not feel the urge to pee). in other hospitals, the bladder is drained with a catheter as needed. ■ your lower and midback are wiped with an antiseptic solution, and a small area of the back is numbed with a local anesthetic. a needle is placed through the numbed area into the epidural space of the spine, usually while you\'re lying on your side or sitting up and leaning over a table or being supported by your coach or nurse. you may feel a little pressure as the needle is inserted or a little tingling or a momentary shooting pain. if you\'re lucky (and many women are), you might not feel a thing. besides, compared to the pain of contractions, any discomfort from a needle poke is likely to be pretty minimal. ■ the needle is removed, leaving a fine, flexible catheter tube in place. the tube is taped to your back so you can move from side to side. three to 5 minutes after the initial dose, the nerves of the uterus begin to numb. usually after 10 minutes, you\'ll begin to feel the full effect. the medication numbs the nerves in the entire lower part of the body, making it hard to feel any contractions at all (and that\'s the point). ■ your blood pressure will be checked frequently to make sure it\'s not dropping too low. iv fluids and lying on your side will help counteract a drop. ■ because an epidural is sometimes associated with the slowing of a baby\'s heartbeat, continuous fetal monitoring is usually required. though such monitoring limits your movements somewhat, it allows your practitioner to monitor the baby\'s heartbeat and allows you to \"see\" the frequency and intensity of your contractions (because, ideally, you won\'t be feeling them). there are few side effects with an epidural, though some women might experience numbness on one side of the body only (as opposed to complete pain relief). epidurals also might not offer complete pain control if you\'re experiencing back labor (when the fetus is in a posterior position, with its head pressing against your back). and keep in mind that you won\'t be able to labor (or deliver) in water if you have an epidural. combined spinal epidural (aka \"walk- ing epidural\"). the combined spinal epidural delivers the same level of pain relief as a traditional epidural, but uses a smaller amount of medication to reach that goal. not all anesthesiologists or hospitals offer this type of epidural (ask your practitioner if it\'ll be available to you). the anesthesiologist will start you off with a shot of analgesic directly into the spinal fluid to help relieve some pain, but because the medication is delivered only in the spinal fluid, you\'ll still feel and be able to use the muscles in your legs, at least somewhat. when you feel you need more pain relief, more medication is placed into the epidural space (through a catheter inserted at","title"

epidural, relying on their coach or a nurse to tell them when a contraction is coming on so they can get busy pushing. but if pain-free pushing isn\'t getting you (or your baby) anywhere-with the lack of sensation hampering your efforts-the epidural can be stopped so you can feel the contractions. the medication can then be easily restarted after delivery to numb the repair of a tear, if necessary. the same time the spinal medication was administered). keep in mind that the nickname walking epidural is misleading. though you\'ll be able to move your legs, they\'ll probably feel weak, so it\'ll be unlikely you\'ll actually want to walk around. spinal block. similar to the epidural, the spinal block is usually given just before delivery. it\'s faster acting and stronger than an epidural, but also lasts for a shorter time. though it is primarily reserved for cesarean deliveries (if an epidural hasn\'t already been started and there\'s less time to spare) it can also be used in a vaginal birth if mom is in the market for speedy pain relief as she closes in on delivery. like the epidural, this regional block is administered by an anesthesiologist while you\'re sitting or lying on your side, but unlike the epidural, no catheter is left in place-it\'s given as a 1-dose injection directly into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord. pudendal block. a pudendal block is usually reserved for the vaginal delivery itself. administered through a needle inserted into the vaginal area, the medication reduces pain in the region but not uterine discomfort. it\'s useful when forceps or vacuum extraction is used, and its effect can last through the repair of a tear or an episiotomy (if needed). general anesthesia. general anesthesia is used rarely, only in specific cases for emergency surgical births. an anesthesiologist injects drugs that put you to sleep into an iv. the major downside to general anesthesia (besides the fact that mom has to miss the birth) is that it sedates the baby along with the mother. the medical team will minimize those sedative effects by administering the anesthesia as close to the actual birth as possible. that way the baby can be delivered before the anesthetic has reached him or her in amounts large enough to have an effect. when you come to, you may be groggy, disoriented, and restless. you may also have a cough and sore throat (due to the tube that\'s routinely inserted through the mouth into the throat) and experience nausea and vomiting (though it\'s less likely if you were given anti-nausea medications in your iv). demerol. this iv-administered drug, which dulls pain and induces a relaxed state, isn\'t often used anymore, but can be useful in certain circumstances-as when a laboring mom needs short-term help coping with contractions. demerol can be repeated every 2 to 4 hours, as needed. keep in mind, though, that if you want to be \"present\" during labor, this probably isn\'t the pain relief for you. many women don\'t like that drugged, drowsy feeling, and some find they are actually less able to cope with labor pain while under the effects of demerol. there may also be some side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and a drop in blood pressure. and if demerol is given to a mom too close to delivery, her baby may be sleepy and unable to suck at birth. less frequently, baby\'s breathing may be depressed and supplemental oxygen may be required. any effects on the newborn are generally short term and can be treated. nitrous oxide. this dentist office staple, more commonly known as laughing gas, doesn\'t eliminate pain (and it definitely won\'t make you break out in giggles), but it does take the edge off contractions and could be a good alternative for women who choose not to go for an epidural. you\'re able to self-administer the laughing gas during labor-taking a few puffs when you feel you need a little relief and setting it aside when you don\'t. not all doctors and hospitals offer laughing gas, so ask ahead if you\'re considering it. tranquilizers. these drugs (such as phenergan and vistaril) are used to calm and relax an extremely anxious mom-to-be so that she can actively participate in the process of labor instead of fighting it. like analgesics, tranquilizers are usually administered once labor is well established, and well before delivery. but they are occasionally used in early labor if a mother\'s anxiety is slowing down the progress of her labor. some women welcome the gentle drowsiness, while others find it keeps them from feeling in control, and also dims the memory of this memorable experience. dosage definitely makes a difference. a small dose may relieve anxiety without impairing alertness. a larger dose may cause slurring of speech and dozing between contraction peaks, making it difficult to use breathing and relaxation techniques learned in childbirth class. though the risks to a fetus or newborn from them are minimal, most practitioners prefer to stay away from tranquilizers unless they\'re really necessary. if you think you might be extremely anxious during labor, you may want to try learning some nondrug relaxation techniques now, so you won\'t end up needing this kind of medication.","title" : "pushing without the pain"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 72,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" :

to bunch up and harden. what\'s going on?\" i t\'s practicing. with delivery right around the corner, your body is warming up for the big day by flexing its muscles-literally. those uterine calisthenics you\'re feeling are called braxton hicks contractions-practice-for-labor contractions that usually begin sometime after the 20th week (though they\'re more noticeable in the last few months of pregnancy). they play a part in pumping up blood flow to the placenta (get ready), toning the muscles of the uterus (get set), and softening the cervix (go . . . soon). these rehearsal contractions (typically experienced earlier and with more intensity in second and subsequent pregnancies) feel like a tightening sensation that begins at the top of your uterus and then spreads downward, lasting from 15 to 30 seconds, though they can sometimes last as long as 2 minutes or more. if you check out your bump while you\'re having a braxton hicks, you might even be able to see what you\'re feeling: your usually round belly might appear pointy or strangely bunched up. weird to watch, but normal. though braxton hicks contractions are not true labor, they may be difficult to distinguish from real labor- especially as they become more intense, which they often do as pregnancy edges to a close. you may notice them more often when you\'ve got a full bladder, if you\'re dehydrated, after sex, when you or baby are very active, or even when someone touches your belly. and though they\'re not efficient enough to deliver your baby (even when they get really uncomfortable), they may give you a leg up on labor by getting effacement and early dilation of the cervix started when the time is right. to relieve any discomfort you may feel when you\'re getting a braxton hicks, try changing your position- lying down and relaxing if you\'ve been on your feet, or getting up and walking around if you\'ve been sitting. a warm bath may also help relieve discomfort. a drink of water may help, too. you can also use this labor rehearsal to practice your breathing exercises and the various other childbirth techniques you\'ve learned, which can make the real contractions easier to deal with when they do arrive. if the contractions don\'t subside with a change in activity, and if they become progressively stronger and more regular (especially if you feel pressure in your lower back), you may be in real labor, so be sure to put in a call to your practitioner. a good rule of thumb: if you have more than 4 braxton hicks in an hour, call your practitioner and let him or her know. if you\'re having a hard time distinguishing braxton hicks contractions from the real thing-especially if this is your first pregnancy and you\'ve never experienced the real thing-give your practitioner a call, being sure to describe exactly what you\'re feeling.","title" : "what you can expect at this month\'s checkup"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 84,"author" : "heidi

in the long list of pregnancy pains that have been kicking you in the butt these days-but you can\'t blame baby\'s kicking for this pain in your ribs. no, those achy-breaky ribs are courtesy of pregnancy hormones, which have been loosening the joints in the area. in some moms-to-be this loosening causes the ribs to bow out (called sublux-ated ribs), to make room for expanded lungs (which need extra oxygen) and an ever-expanding uterus. you may also be feeling the ache because of inflammation of the cartilage attached to the ribs as they loosen and expand (and possibly because of the pressure placed on the ribs by your uterus or larger-than-usual breasts), or rarely, because of a dislocated rib (again, because of rib expansion to accommodate your pregnancy). there is some relief in sight: your ribs may feel less stretched-and less achy-during the last few weeks of pregnancy, when your baby moves down into position for birth-and of course once you deliver. until then, keep the clothes you\'re wearing loose so you\'re not putting more pressure on those aching ribs, especially when you\'re sleeping (or trying to sleep). a pregnancy belly-support band can help to evenly distribute the weight of your growing belly, removing the strain off the muscles of the abdomen, which pull on the ribs and cause rib pain. shifting positions may also lessen your discomfort, as may a warm bath or a heating pad placed over your clothes. nothing working? acetaminophen (tylenol) can help ease the ache. and be sure to avoid heavy lifting, which can make it worse (and which you shouldn\'t be doing now anyway). \"sometimes i get the feeling like my baby has jammed his feet up into my rib cage, and it hurts.\" o ccasionally, a baby will manage to wedge a foot into his mama\'s ribs- and that\'s one kind of rib tickling that doesn\'t tickle. you may be able to change baby\'s position by changing yours, or by bouncing on a birthing ball. or, you can also try a gentle nudge or a few pelvic tilts to dislodge that little foot. or try this mama move: sit up straight and take a deep breath while you raise one arm over your head, then exhale while you drop your arm and repeat with the other arm. baby\'s not budging, at least not for long? sometimes the rib jamming becomes chronic, lasting until your little pain-in-the-ribs engages, or drops into your pelvis, which usually

murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"sometimes i have trouble breathing, even when i\'m just sitting doing nothing. does that mean my baby isn\'t getting enough oxygen?\" i t\'s not surprising you\'re feeling a little spare on air these days. your ever-expanding uterus is now crowding out all your other internal organs in an effort to provide spacious-enough accommodations for your ever-growing baby. among those organs feeling the crunch are your lungs, which your uterus has compressed, limiting their ability to expand fully when you take a breath. this, teamed with the extra progesterone that has already been leaving you breathless for months, explains why a trip upstairs these days can make you feel as if you\'ve just run a marathon (winded, big time). fortunately, while this shortness of breath may feel uncomfortable to you, it doesn\'t bother your baby in the least. your little one is kept well stocked with all the oxygen he or she needs through the placenta-no breathing, deep or otherwise, needed. some relief from that winded feeling usually arrives toward the end of pregnancy, when your baby drops into your pelvis in preparation for birth (in first pregnancies this generally occurs 2 to 3 weeks before delivery, in subsequent deliveries often not until labor begins). until then, be sure to take it easy and slow down, decreasing the amount of work your lungs have to do. you may find it easier to breathe if you sit straight up instead of slumped over and sleep in a semi-propped position, bolstered by 2 or 3 pillows. when you\'re feeling especially breathless, lift your arms over your head to take pressure off your rib cage so you can breathe in more air. try some breathing exercises as well: breathe in slowly and deeply, making sure your rib cage-not your abdomen-is expanding (put your hands on the sides of your rib cage and make sure the ribs push out against your hands as you inhale deeply). breathe out slowly and deeply, feeling the contraction of your rib cage. return to this type of deep breathing whenever you feel a little breathless. sometimes breathlessness can be a sign that iron stores are low, so check in with your practitioner about it. call 911 or head to the er if shortness of breath is severe and accompanied by rapid breathing, blueness of the lips and fingertips, sweating, chest pain, and/or rapid

much easier. it will also allow for an informed-not rushed-decision. if you\'re not sure where to begin your search, ask your practitioner for a referral (if you\'ve been generally happy with the care you\'ve been getting during pregnancy) or poll friends, neighbors, or coworkers who have young children for their favorite pediatricians. you can also look online for local pediatrician groups (though online listings of physicians are not always accurate) or local parent groups to ask for their recommendations. or contact the hospital or birthing center where you\'ll be delivering (you can call the labor and delivery floor or pediatrics, and ask a nurse on duty for some suggestions-no one gets a better look at doctors than nurses do). of course, if you\'re on a health insurance plan that limits your choices, you\'ll have to pick from that list. once you\'ve narrowed your options to 2 or 3, call for consultations-most pediatricians or family practitioners will oblige. bring a list of questions about issues that are important to you, such as office protocol (for instance, whether there are call-in hours for parents or when you can expect calls to be returned), breastfeeding support, circumcision, the use of antibiotics, whether the doctor handles all well-baby visits or if they\'re typically handled by nurse-practitioners in the practice. also important to know: is the

bladder control-which can cause you to spring a small leak when you cough, sneeze, lift something heavy, or even laugh (though there\'s nothing funny about that)-is the result of the mounting pressure of your growing uterus on your bladder. some expectant moms also experience urge incontinence, the overwhelming, seemingly out-of-nowhere need to pee (gotta go now!) during late pregnancy. try these tips to help prevent or control stress or urge incontinence: ■ empty your bladder as completely as possible by leaning forward each time you pee. ■ practice your kegels. being faithful to your kegels will help prevent or correct most cases of pregnancy-induced incontinence-plus, looking ahead, they\'ll also help prevent postpartum incontinence of both the urinary and fecal variety. for a kegel how-to, see page 229. ■ do kegels or cross your legs when you feel a cough, sneeze, or laugh coming on, or the urge to pee coming on. ■ wear a panty liner if you need one or you\'re afraid you\'ll need one. graduate to a maxipad (or bladder control pad) when leaks might be especially inconvenient. ■ stay as regular as you can, because impacted stool can put pressure on the bladder. also, straining hard when you\'re pooping can weaken pelvic floor muscles. for tips on fighting constipation, see page 185. ■ if it\'s the urge that\'s driving you crazy (and always sending you to the bathroom in a hurry), try training your bladder. urinate more frequently- about every 30 minutes to an hour- so that you go before you feel that uncontrollable need. after a week, try to gradually stretch the time between bathroom visits, adding 15 minutes more at a time. ■ continue drinking enough fluids, even if you experience stress incontinence or frequent urges. limiting your fluid intake will not limit leaks, and it may lead to a uti and/or dehydration. not only can both of these lead to a lot of other problems (including preterm contractions), but utis can make stress and urge incontinence worse. see page 528 for tips on keeping your urinary tract healthy. to be sure that the leak you\'ve sprung is urine (which it almost certainly is) and not amniotic fluid, it\'s smart to

because there\'s more area for her uterus and her baby to spread out in. same for some very obese women-with so much room in an already ample abdomen, these moms-to-be may never seem to \"pop\" at all. ■ your muscle tone. a mom-to-be with very tight muscles may not show as soon or as much as one whose muscles are slacker. for that reason, and because each baby tends to end up a little larger than the last, second- and more-time moms tend to end up a bit larger, too. ■ your baby\'s position. how your fetus is positioned on the inside may also affect how big or small you look on the outside. ■ your weight gain. a bigger weight gain doesn\'t necessarily predict a bigger baby, just a bigger mom. if you\'ve kept your weight gain within recommended guidelines, you may appear smaller because you\'re sporting less fat, not because you\'re carrying less baby. the only assessments of a baby\'s size that are worth paying attention to are the ones you get from your practitioner- not the ones you get from your sister-in-law, your coworkers, social media buddies commenting on your bump selfies, or know-it-all nosey-bodies in the supermarket checkout line.","title" : "how you\'re

don\'t worry about back labor yet. most babies turn accommodatingly to the anterior position during labor. some midwives recommend giving baby a nudge before labor begins by getting on all fours and doing pelvic rocks. others suggest placing warm towels on mom\'s back and cold ones on her tummy because babies naturally turn away from cold. these tactics can also be tried during labor. whether they can successfully flip a baby is unclear, but they can\'t hurt. and who knows-they could help relieve any back pain you have now. stays relaxed, and you may also get an epidural (which not only prevents any pain but also keeps the uterus relaxed, apparently boosting the odds of ecv success). your practitioner will apply his or her hands to your abdomen, one near baby\'s head, one near baby\'s bottom (you\'ll feel some pressure, and possibly some discomfort, though not if you\'ve had an epidural) and try to gently turn your little one around. ecv is successful in nearly two-thirds of attempts. the success rate is even higher for those who have an epidural as well as those who have delivered before (thanks to those more lax uterine and abdominal muscles), but it\'s slightly lower for obese women, since abdominal padding can make maneuvering baby more challenging. the more experience a doctor has in turning babies, the better the success rate generally is (some doctors have a rate as high as 90 percent). and happily the complications rate is low across the board (less than 1 percent for serious complications that might lead to an emergency c-section). some babies refuse to turn at all (though often a doctor will suggest multiple attempts), and a small number of contrary fetuses turn and then flip back into a breech position (in which case, your doctor might also suggest trying again). having multiples?

there are a number of reasons: bigger babies. with more expectant moms exceeding the recommended weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds, and with the rate of gd increasing, more large babies, who may be more difficult to deliver vaginally, are arriving. a wrinkle: since estimates of a baby\'s birthweight based on ultrasound measurements can be unreliable (in about 20 percent of cases, estimates are high), a baby who\'s predicted to be too large to deliver vaginally may end up not so big after all. these over-estimates sometimes result in unnecessary scheduled c-sections. bigger moms. the c-section rate has also risen with the obesity rate. being obese (or gaining too much weight during pregnancy) significantly increases a woman\'s chance of needing a c-section, partly because of other risk factors that accompany obesity (diabetes, for instance, or hypertension), partly because obese women tend to have longer labors, and longer labors are more likely to end up on the operating table. older mothers. more and more women in their late 30s (and well into their 40s) are now able to have successful pregnancies, and though their rates of c-sections have been dropping, older moms are still more likely to require a surgical delivery. the same is true of women with chronic health problems. multiples. more and more multiples are being born these days, and there\'s a higher chance of delivering via cesarean if you\'re birthing multiple babies (though a vaginal birth with twins is often possible; see page 455). repeat c-sections. though vbac is still considered a viable option in many cases, and though more and more experts are encouraging vbacs, fewer doctors and hospitals are allowing moms to try one, and more are scheduling surgeries instead of attempting a trial of labor (see page 357 for reasons why). fewer instrumental deliveries. fewer babies are being born with the help of vacuum extraction and even fewer with forceps. that\'s largely because training in these instrumental deliveries dropped off as c-section rates took off-so many doctors feel more comfortable going straight for the surgical option, when they might have (back in","title" : "reasons for a scheduled c"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 102,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "o ften the decision to perform a c-section is made only once labor is well under way-and it\'s usually to ensure the safety of the mom and her baby. sometimes it\'s because labor fails to progress (the cervix isn\'t dilating, even after attempts have been made to give sluggish contractions a boost with oxytocin, or it\'s taking too long to push the baby out, and delivery with vacuum extractor or forceps has failed or isn\'t appropriate). sometimes it\'s because there\'s fetal distress (the baby\'s heart rate has plummeted to a dangerously low level), or because the uterus has ruptured, or because of a prolapsed umbilical cord (when the cord slips out the birth canal before the baby does, running the risk of being compressed and depriving the baby of oxygen). as always, the safety of both mom and baby will be the prime consideration in whether to turn to a surgical delivery. the day) routinely tried an instrument-assisted birth first. this may change as ob training begins to reflect changing attitudes about these delivery options. requests by moms. since cesarean deliveries are safe and can prevent the pain of labor while keeping the perineum neatly intact, some women (particularly those who\'ve had a c-section before) still prefer them to vaginal deliveries and actually ask ahead for one (see page 359). these numbers are dropping, however, especially as many practitioners have begun discouraging medically unnecessary c-sections. that\'s because unnecessary c-sections come with unnecessary risks, while vaginal deliveries-when they\'re possible-are safer, especially for mom. time limits in labor. some doctors put time limits on how long labor should last-how long it \"should\" take for the cervix to dilate, for instance, or how long a mom \"should\" push. when artificial time limits are placed on the length of labor, doctors may proceed to a surgical delivery before giving the laboring mom (and her baby) a fair chance to progress. see the box on page 424 for more on these time limits. happily there are now strong efforts under way to change the recommendations on how long to let a mom labor and push before resorting to a c-section (assuming everything is still proceeding safely)-and that\'s a \"push\" that may do a lot to help bring the rate of cesarean deliveries down. another change that may push c-section rates down: f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "c-section decision during labor"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 103,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "wondering if your partner\'s scheduled c-section means your coaching days are over-even before they\'ve started?

not so fast. childbirth education classes still have plenty to offer you and your partner (including plenty on what to expect with a c-section-and with an epidural). most classes also offer invaluable advice on taking care of your newborn (which you\'ll have to master no matter which exit your baby takes), breastfeed-ing, and possibly getting back into shape postpartum. and don\'t tune out when the teacher\'s going over the labor breathing routine with the other couples. you might find those skills come in handy when you\'re trying to stay relaxed in the or-or after delivery, when you\'re confronted with both post-op pain and assorted postpartum aches. prior cesarean delivery (or even 2, in some cases). research shows that the very low risk of uterine rupture (less than 1 percent) is only elevated during vbac under certain less common circumstances (see below). what\'s more, vbac attempts are successful a full two-thirds of the time-meaning that a mom who tries vbac is just as likely to end up with a vaginal delivery as a mom who never had a c-section. yet, with all the mounting evidence-and all the experts-backing up vbac, many doctors and hospitals won\'t even consider a vaginal delivery for a mom who has already had a c-section. more than 90 percent of women eligible for trying vbac end up having a scheduled cesarean delivery instead. why are vbac rates so low? the answer lies more in hospital policies and high malpractice insurance rates than in the safety of vbac. some hospitals have stopped offering vbacs because of safety and liability concerns and a shortage of staff and resources to handle emergencies. that said, there are still plenty of hospitals and doctors, some birthing centers, and many midwives who are open to (and enthusiastically encourage) vbacs. so your first step, if you do decide you\'d like to attempt a vbac, is to find a practitioner who is open to it. and then, taking into account the many factors that are predictive of a successful vbac, you and your practitioner can decide whether it\'s the best choice in your case. here are a few of those factors: vbac is recommended only if labor starts spontaneously. if you have to be induced (especially with prostaglandins), vbac is generally not considered an option. that\'s because induction (and the stronger contractions it triggers) ups the risk of uterine rupture. vbac is recommended only if you have a low-transverse uterine scar. and there\'s over a 90 percent chance that you do. vertical uterine incisions (which are more likely to result in a uterine rupture and usually take vbac off the table) are rarely used. vbac is more likely to succeed if the reason for your last c-section no longer exists. for instance, if you had a c-section because of something unique to your previous pregnancy that isn\'t affecting your current pregnancy-maybe your baby was breech last time but is head-down this time-then a successful vbac becomes more likely. on the other hand, if you needed a c-section because the size or shape of your pelvis led to an especially slow or stalled labor the first time around, you may encounter the same problem the next time you try to deliver vaginally, making the chances of successful vbac lower. vbac is more likely to succeed if you start out pregnancy at a healthy weight and if you kept your pregnancy weight gain on target. research shows that vbac success is 40 percent lower among women who gained more than 40 pounds during pregnancy compared to women who gained less than that. overweight and obese women who attempt vbacs are also less likely to successfully deliver vaginally in general, even after accounting for baby\'s larger size (a large baby is more common in overweight women). vbac is more likely to succeed if your baby is average size. research shows that the chance of vbac failure is 50 percent higher when babies weigh more than 8 pounds 13 ounces at delivery, compared to babies weighing less than 7 pounds 11 ounces. a large baby may also increase the risk of uterine rupture and perineal tears-which is one","title" : "scheduled classes for scheduled c\'s"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 107,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "while it\'s true that pregnancy isn\'t the time to learn to water ski, snowboard, or enter a horse-jumping competition, you\'ll still be able to enjoy most fitness activities-and use many of the machines at the gym (with a few caveats). you can select, too, from the growing number of exercise programs specifically designed for expecting moms (pregnancy water aerobics, pregnancy pilates, and prenatal yoga classes, for example). but be sure to ask your practitioner about what\'s okay and what\'s not when it comes to choosing an exercise program or sport. you\'ll probably find that most of the activities that are off-limits when you\'re expecting are ones you\'d probably have a hard time doing well anyway once you have a basketball-size belly (like competitive basketball . . . or football or scuba diving or downhill racing or mountain biking). here are the do\'s and don\'ts of pregnancy workouts: walking. just about anyone can do it- and do it just about anywhere, anytime. there\'s no easier exercise to fit into your busy schedule than walking (don\'t forget, all the walking you do counts, even if it\'s walking 2 blocks to the market or 10 minutes while the dog does her business). and you can continue to fit it in right up until delivery day (and even on delivery day if you\'re eager to get those contractions moving along). best of all, there\'s no equipment necessary-and no gym membership or classes to pay for, either. all you need is a supportive pair of sneakers and comfortable, breathable clothes. if you\'re just beginning a walking routine, go slowly at first (start out at a stroll before you move on to a brisk pace). weather\'s not cooperative? do a power mall walk. jogging. experienced runners can stay on track during pregnancy-but you may want to limit your distances and stick to level terrain or use a treadmill (if you weren\'t a runner prepregnancy, stick to brisk walking for now). keep in mind that loosening ligaments and joints during pregnancy can literally be a pain, make running harder on your knees, and also make you more prone to injury-all good reasons to listen to your pregnant body and adjust your runs accordingly exercise machines. treadmills, ellipticals, and stair-climbers are all good bets during pregnancy. adjust speed, incline, and tension to a level that\'s comfortable for you (starting out slowly if you\'re a rookie). toward the end of your pregnancy, though, you may find a machine workout too strenuous (or maybe not-as always, take your cues from your body). you may also have to be more conscious of avoiding stumbles on the machine when you\'re no longer able to see your feet. swimming and water workouts. consider this: in the water, you weigh just a tenth of what you do on land (how often do you have the chance to be close to weightless these days?), making water workouts the perfect choice for a pregnant woman. working out in the water boosts your strength and flexibility but is gentle on your joints-plus there\'s much less risk of overheating (unless the pool is overheated). what\'s more, many pregnant women report that water workouts help ease swelling in their legs and feet and relieve sciatic pain. most gyms with a pool offer water aerobics, and many have classes specifically designed for expectant moms. just be careful when walking on slippery pool sides, and don\'t dive in. yoga. yoga encourages relaxation, focus, and paying attention to your breathing-so it\'s just about perfect for","title" : "choosing the right pregnancy workouts"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 108,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "i s more (exercise) more-or less? that depends. if you\'re really ambitious (or just really fit), and you\'ve been green-lighted by your practitioner (based on your fitness level), it\'s safe to work out for up to an hour or even more, as long as you listen to your body. moms-to-be tend to tire out sooner than they used to, and tired bodies are more apt to injure themselves. plus, overexertion could lead to other problems-for instance, dehydration if you don\'t take in enough fluids, or lack of oxygen to the baby if you\'re short of breath for long periods. burning more calories during your marathon sessions also means you\'ll need to take in more, so be sure to compensate appropriately (the best part of a workout, wouldn\'t you say?). pregnancy (and great preparation for childbirth, as well as for parenting). it also increases oxygenation (bringing more oxygen to the baby) and increases flexibility, possibly making pregnancy-and delivery-easier. select a class that\'s specifically tailored to expectant women or ask your instructor how to modify poses so that they\'re safe for you. for instance, you probably shouldn\'t exercise on your back after the 4th month, and as pregnancy progresses your center of gravity changes, so you\'ll have to adjust your favorite poses accordingly. and unless you\'re an experienced yoga inversion practitioner, you should probably avoid full inversions (handstand, supported shoulder stand, and supported headstand) after the 3rd month-not only because your balance will be off, but also because of potential blood pressure issues. some doctors and midwives say half inversions-like downward facing dog-are okay during pregnancy. another important caveat: avoid bikram or hot yoga. it\'s done in a very warm room (one that\'s generally 90°f to 100°f), and you\'ll need to take a pass during pregnancy on any workouts that heat you up too much. pilates. pilates is similar to yoga in that it\'s a discipline that improves your flexibility, strength, and muscle tone with no- to low-impact. the focus is on strengthening your core, which will ease backaches and improve your posture (important for preventing aches and pains when you\'re toting a baby in your belly, but also when you\'re toting one in your arms). look for a class specifically tailored to pregnant women, or let your instructor know that you\'re expecting so you can avoid pregnancy-inappropriate moves (including those that overstretch) or equipment that isn\'t compatible with pregnancy. dance/aerobics. zumba, mama? experienced athletes in good shape can continue all types of dance (like belly dancing, ballroom dancing, hip-hop or salsa, zumba, and so on) and aerobic workouts during pregnancy. but dance with care. tone down the intensity level, avoid jumping or high-impact movements, and never exert yourself to the point of exhaustion. if you\'re a beginner, choose low-impact aerobics or consider the water version, which is uniquely suited to the pregnant set. barre classes. these ballet-inspired workouts are great when you\'re expecting because they include lots of legwork with minimal jumping. the balance exercises and core strengthening are pregnancy perfect, too, especially when your swelling belly slackens the core and throws you off balance. so belly up to the barre, but with a little mom-to-be modification: since some of the lower-body movements may put strain on your back, especially as your belly gets bigger, adapt movements (such as by getting to your hands and knees for certain positions) as needed. step routines. as long as you\'re already in good shape and have experience doing step routines, it\'s usually fine to stay in step with them now. just remember that your joints are more prone to injury when you\'re pregnant, so stretch out well beforehand and don\'t overexert yourself. and of course, don\'t step on something too high off the ground. as your abdomen expands, avoid any activities that require careful balance. spinning. is spinning in when you\'re expecting? if you\'ve been spinning for at least 6 months before pregnancy, you should be able to continue, but tone down the workout (and let the instructor know you\'re expecting so you\'re not pushed too hard). remember to take it down a notch if you\'re panting or gasping for breath. and for maximum comfort, adjust the handlebars so they\'re closer to you, allowing you to sit back instead of leaning forward, which could make your lower back ache more than it likely already does. stay seated, since standing while spinning is too intense for a mama-to-be. if spinning suddenly seems exhausting, take a bike break until after the baby\'s born (and after you\'ve recovered from childbirth). kickboxing. kickboxing takes grace and speed-two things pregnant women don\'t typically possess lots of. many pregnant kickboxers find they can\'t kick as high or move as quickly, but if you\'re still comfortable getting your exercise from getting your kicks, and you have plenty of experience (no novices now), it\'s okay to continue while you\'re expecting. just be sure to avoid any movements that you have difficulty with or cause you to strain. make sure you keep a safe distance from other kickboxers (you don\'t want to be kicked in the belly by accident) by leaving 2 leg lengths of space between you and those around you. be sure, too, that everyone in the class knows you\'re pregnant, or look for pregnancy-specific classes (where everyone around you is pregnant-and far away). weight training. using weights can increase your muscle tone (and get your biceps ready for lifing baby), but it\'s important to avoid heavy weights or those that require grunting or breath holding, which may compromise blood flow to the uterus. use light weights with multiple repetitions instead. ask your practitioner about what modifications you\'ll need to make to your trx routine (or whether you should retire the equipment for the duration) and skip those crossfit routines for now (unless you\'ve been at it for years and your practitioner gives you the thumbs-up). outdoor sports (hiking, skating, bicy- cling, skiing). pregnancy isn\'t the time to take up a new sport-especially one that challenges your balance-but experienced athletes should be able to continue these activities with their practitioner\'s approval and some sensible precautions. when hiking, be sure to avoid uneven terrain (especially later on in pregnancy when it won\'t be easy to see that rock in your path), high altitudes, and slippery conditions-and of course, rock climbing is out. when biking, be extra careful-wear a helmet, don\'t ride on wet pavement, winding paths, or bumpy surfaces (falling is never a good idea but especially not when you\'re pregnant), and don\'t lean forward into racing posture (it can tax your lower back, plus this isn\'t the time for speeding-slow and steady should win all your races now). as for ice skating, you can give it a whirl (and a figure 8) early in pregnancy if you\'re experienced and careful-later on, you\'ll probably face balance issues, so stop as soon as you get more bulky than graceful. ditto for in-line skating and horseback riding. avoid downhill skiing or snowboarding altogether, even if you\'ve got years of double black diamonds under your belt-the risk of a serious fall or collision is too great (even pros take the occasional tumble-and there\'s no gauging the skill of others around you). cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are okay for the experienced, but you\'ll have to be extra careful to avoid falling. tai chi. an ancient form of meditative exercises, tai chi\'s basic slow movements allow even the least limber the opportunity to relax and strengthen the body without the risk of injury. if you\'re comfortable with it and have experience, it\'s fine to continue tai chi now. look for pregnancy-specific classes, or just stick to moves you can easily complete-take extra care with the balancing poses.","title" : "30 minutes plus?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 109,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "n ever been to a gym?

(don\'t bounce as you stretch.) clamming   tailor stretch biceps curl  clamming. lie on your right side with legs slightly forward and knees bent and stacked on top of each other. place a pillow under your head and a flat pillow under your belly for support. stack your hips, and keep your spine straight and abs drawn in (as best you can). keeping your toes touching, rotate at your left hip and lift the left knee, taking your knees apart as far as possible. slowly lower and repeat for 8 to 10 reps, then switch sides. squats. this exercise strengthens and tones your thighs. to begin, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. keeping your back straight, bend at the knees (making sure they don\'t extend past your toes) and slowly lower yourself as close to the ground as you comfortably can. hold the squat for 10 to 30 seconds, then slowly come back to a standing position. repeat 5 times. (note: avoid lunges and deep knee bends, since your joints are more prone to injury.) waist twists. if you\'ve been sitting for a while or just feel generally tensed up or uncomfortable, try this easy circulation-boosting move. stand up and place your feet shoulder-width apart. twist gently from the waist, slowly turning from side to side. keep your back straight and let your arms swing freely. can\'t get up? you can do this exercise even while you\'re sitting. hip flexors. stretching the hip flexor muscles periodically will help keep you limber and make it easier for you to open your legs wide when it\'s time for the baby to exit. to flex your flexors, stand at the bottom of a flight of stairs as though you were about to climb them. (hang on to the railing with one hand for support if you need to.) place one foot on the first or second stair up (whatever you can comfortably reach) and bend your knee. keep your other leg behind you, knee straight, foot flat on the floor. lean into your bent leg, keeping your back straight. you\'ll feel the stretch in your straight leg. switch legs and repeat.  hip flexors  squats  waist twists chest stretches. gently stretching your chest muscles will help you feel more comfortable while improving your circulation. here\'s how: with your arms at shoulder level and bent, grasp both sides of a doorway. lean forward, feeling the stretch in your chest. hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds and release. do 5 reps. triangle pose. this pose works the legs, stretches the side of the body, energizes the hips, and opens up the shoulders (which might be drooping these days). stand with your feet wider than hip distance apart and turn your right foot outward to 90 degrees and your left foot inward slightly so you are comfortably balanced. raise your arms sideways to shoulder level, keeping them parallel to the floor with your palms facing downward. resist the urge to let your shoulders rise up to your ears. take a deep breath in. exhale slowly and bend at the waist as much as is comfortable to your right side. extend your right hand downward toward your right ankle. (no need to touch your ankle when you\'re contending with a big belly-getting to your shin is just fine.) lift your left arm up, bringing it in line with your lowered right arm. try to keep both your

as well as watch them shake your belly!). and your one-of-a-kind baby is truly one of a kind now, complete with unique fingerprints on those tiny fingertips and toes. week 19 this week your baby is hitting the growth charts at 6 inches long and just over a full half pound in weight. what fruit is it this week? your baby\'s about the size of a large mango. a mango dipped in greasy cheese, actually. vernix caseosa-a greasy white protective substance that resembles cheese-now covers your baby\'s sensitive skin, protecting it from that long soak in an amniotic bath. without that protection, your baby would look very wrinkled at birth. the coating sheds as delivery approaches, but some babies born early are still covered with vernix when they arrive. week 20 you\'ve got a baby the size of a small cantaloupe in your melon-size belly this week, about 10 ounces and 6½ inches (crown to rump). your ultrasound this month should be able to detect-if you want to know-whether your baby is a boy or a girl. and oh boy-or oh girl-has that baby been busy. if you\'re having a girl, her uterus is fully formed, her ovaries are holding about 7 million primitive eggs (though at birth, the number of eggs will have dropped to closer to 2 million-more than enough to keep her covered during her reproductive years), and her vaginal canal is starting to develop. if you\'re having a boy, his testicles have begun their descent from the abdomen. in a few months, they\'ll drop into the scrotum (which is still under construction). luckily for your baby, there\'s still plenty of room in your womb for twisting, turning, kicking, punching, and even an occasional somersault. if you haven\'t felt these acrobatics yet, you almost certainly will in the coming weeks. week 21 how big is baby this week? switching from crown-to-rump to crown-to-heel length, about 10½ inches in length (think large carrot) and almost 11 to 12½ ounces in weight. and speaking of carrots, you might want to eat some this week if you\'d like your baby to have a taste for them. that\'s because the flavor of amniotic fluid differs from day to day, depending on what you\'ve eaten (hot chili one day, mild carrot another), and now that your baby is swallowing amniotic fluid each day (for hydration, nutrition, and also to get practice swallowing and digesting), he or she will be getting a virtual taste of-and a taste for-whatever\'s on your menu. here\'s another baby update: arms and legs are finally in proportion, neurons are now connected between the brain and muscles, and cartilage throughout the body is turning to bone. which means that when your baby makes those moves (which you\'re probably feeling by now), they\'re much more coordinated-no more jerky twitches. week 22 forget about ounces, baby. this week, we\'re talking a whopping weight of 1 pound and a crown-to-heel length of approximately 11 inches, about the size of a small doll. but your doll is a living one-with developing senses, including touch, sight, hearing, and taste. what\'s your baby touching? he or she may grab on to the umbilical cord (there\'s not much else to hang on to in there) and practice the strong grip that will soon be clutching your fingers (and pulling on your hair). what\'s your baby seeing? though it\'s dark in the uterine cocoon-and even with fused eyelids-fetuses this age can perceive light and dark. if you shine a flashlight over your belly, you might feel your baby react, perhaps trying to turn away from the jarring light. what\'s your baby hearing? the sound of your voice and that of your partner, your heart beating, the whoosh-whoosh of your blood your baby, month 5 circulating through your body, those gastric gurgles produced by your stomach and intestines, the dog barking, sirens, a

hot stuff these days? you can thank your hormones (as always) plus increased blood flow to the skin and a hopped-up pregnancy winter), and the heat is on-big time. luckily, there are plenty of ways to stay comfortable when the temperature inside you is soaring. to stay cool while you\'re heating for two: ■ wear loose, light clothing in cotton or other breathable fabrics, and dress in layers so you can peel them off as you heat up. natural fibers when you sleep, too- from your pj\'s to your pillow. ■ to chill out fast, put ice packs, cold compresses, or cold running water on your inner wrists. since it\'s a pulse point, the cold temp on the outside will help cool the blood inside. you can also try cold compresses on other pulse points whenever you\'re heating up: your neck, ankles, and behind the knees. ■ put any lotions you use in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before you apply. when you rub the cold creams on your skin, it\'ll help cool you down. ■ no time for a cold shower? you can wet your hands with cold water and then run your fingers through your hair (assuming you don\'t mind your hair being wet). a cooler head will prevail in cooling down your body. or keep a spray bottle of water in the fridge (at home and on the job) for a cold spritz. ■ munch on a bunch of frozen grapes. not only will you net some vitamin c and k, this delicious chilled snack will help cool you down (and it\'s a whole lot lower in fat than ice cream). not a grape lover? you can freeze any type of cut up fruit (think mango, banana, berries, and so on) and grab it when you\'re heating up. or stay hydrated and cool by freezing your water bottle and sipping the icy water as it melts. and speaking of munching, remember that the 6-meal solution is the solution for overheating problems, too. eating lightly more frequently will require less effort to digest. spicy food may heat you up in the short term, but because it\'ll get you sweating, it\'ll cool you down later. ■ a sprinkle of cornstarch-based pow- der can help absorb moisture (plus help to prevent heat rash). sprinkle it on your skin while it\'s still dry. on the plus side, while you\'ll be more sweaty-you\'ll be less smelly. that\'s because the production of apocrine perspiration (the stinkier kind produced by glands under the arms and breasts and in the genital area) slows down when you\'re expecting.","title" :

yesterday while i was shopping, i almost felt like i was going to black out for a minute. am i okay?\" f eeling a little dizzy can definitely be unsettling when you\'re pregnant (especially because you might already be having a hard enough time staying on your feet or keeping your balance), but it isn\'t dangerous. in fact, it\'s a pretty common-and almost always normal- symptom of pregnancy. here\'s why: ■ throughout your pregnancy, high lev- els of your old friend progesterone cause your blood vessels to relax and widen, increasing the flow of blood to your baby (good for baby) but slowing the return of blood to you (not so good for mom). less blood flow to you means lower blood pressure and reduced blood flow to your brain, which can contribute to that lightheaded, dizzy feeling. in the second trimester, that faint feeling may be caused by the pressure of your expanding uterus on your blood vessels. it can also be a sign of anemia (see next question). ■ getting up too quickly, which causes a sudden blood pressure drop, can trigger an especially lightheaded moment. the cure for that kind of dizziness (also known as postural hypotension) is simple: just get up gradually. jumping up in a hurry to answer a text on the phone you left across the room is likely to land you right back on the sofa. ■ low blood sugar-something expec- tant moms are particularly prone to, since they\'re fueling a baby factory- might also send the room spinning. to avoid those blood sugar dips, get some protein and complex carbs at every meal (this combo helps maintain even blood sugar levels) and eat more frequently (choosing the mini-meal approach or snacking in between meals). carry trail mix, some freeze-dried fruit, nuts, a granola bar, or some whole-grain chips in your bag for quick blood sugar lifts. ■ dizziness can be a sign of dehydra- tion, so be sure you\'re getting enough fluids-and that you\'re chug-a-lugging more if you\'ve been sweating. ■ a dizzy spell can also be triggered by indoor stuffiness-in an overheated or crowded store, office, or bus- especially if you\'re overdressed. in that case, getting some fresh air by stepping outside or opening a window may bring relief. taking off your coat and loosening your clothes-especially around the neck and waist- should help, too. if you feel dizzy or like you\'re about to faint, lie down on your left side-with your legs elevated, if you can-or sit with your head lowered between your knees. take deep breaths, and loosen any tight clothing (like that button on your jeans). as soon as you feel a little better, get something to eat and drink. tell your practitioner about the dizzy spells. he or she may want to check your iron levels to rule out anemia. actual fainting is rare, but if you do faint, there is no need for concern-it won\'t affect your baby. but do call your practitioner as soon as possible.","title" : "dizziness"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 118,"author" : "heidi

and when it comes to prevention, your practitioner almost certainly has your back. you were already tested for anemia at your first prenatal visit, though it\'s unlikely you were low on iron then. that\'s because iron stores are quickly replenished once those monthly periods stop.","title" : "anemia"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 119,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "feel breathless or exhausted when you\'re jogging? what about when you\'re doing heavy cleaning-does the vacuum cleaner suddenly feel as if it weighs a ton? stop before you drop. exerting yourself to the point of exhaustion is never a good idea. during pregnancy it\'s a particularly bad one, because overwork takes its toll not only on you but on your baby as well. instead of marathon activity sessions, pace yourself. work or exercise a bit, then rest a bit. ultimately, the work or the workout gets done, and you won\'t feel drained afterward. if occasionally something doesn\'t get done, consider it good training for the days when the demands of parenthood will frequently keep you from finishing what you started. as your pregnancy progresses and you hit the halfway mark (around 20 weeks, coming right up), your blood volume expands significantly and the amount of iron needed for producing red blood cells dramatically increases, depleting those stores once again. fortunately, refilling those stores-and effectively preventing anemia-is as easy as taking a daily iron supplement (in addition to your prenatal vitamin), which your practitioner may prescribe starting midway through pregnancy. you should also pump up your diet by eating foods loaded with iron. though dietary sources, such as the ones listed on page 97, may not do the job alone, they provide a great backup for an iron supplement. for extra absorption, chase your iron (and iron-rich foods) down with your morning oj (or another vitamin c-rich food or drink) but not with your morning java, which will

iron deficiency rarely have noticeable symptoms-or symptoms that are easily distinguished from pregnancy symptoms (most expectant moms are tired whether they\'re anemic or not). but as oxygen-carrying red blood cells are further depleted, an anemic mother-to-be becomes pale, extremely weak, and easily tired or very breathless (beyond what\'s normal in pregnancy), and might even experience fainting spells. she may experience strange cravings for nonfood items, like clay, or a compulsion to chew ice. there\'s also a possibility that rls, or restless leg syndrome, may be linked to low iron stores. this may be one of the few instances where fetal nutritional needs are met before a mom\'s, since babies are rarely iron deficient at birth. though the increased demand for blood production during pregnancy makes all moms-to-be susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia, some are at particularly high risk: those who\'ve had back-to-back pregnancies, those who have been vomiting a lot or eating little because of morning sickness, and those who came to pregnancy undernourished (possibly because of an eating disorder) and/or have been eating poorly since they conceived. daily iron supplementation, as prescribed by your practitioner, should prevent (or treat) anemia. not just bloated-compounds the problem. the result: a deeply curved lower back, strained back muscles, and pain. even pain with a purpose hurts. but without defeating the purpose, you can conquer (or at least subdue) the pain. the following should help: ■ sit smart. sitting puts more stress on your spine than almost any other activity, so it pays to do it right. at home and at work, make sure the chairs you use most provide good support, preferably with firm cushioning and arms. a chair back that reclines slightly can also help take the pressure off. use a footrest to elevate your feet slightly (see illustration, above), and don\'t cross your legs, which can cause your pelvis to tilt forward, exacerbating those strained back muscles. a walking and stretching break-setting a half-hour limit would be even better. ■ try not to stand too long, either. if you work on your feet, keep one foot on a low stool to take some pressure off your lower back. when you\'re standing on a hard surface-in the kitchen while cooking or washing dishes, for example-put on supportive shoes or use a small skid-proof cushioned rug underfoot to ease the pressure. ■ be a slow lifter. avoid lifting heavy loads, but if you must, do it slowly. first, stabilize yourself by assuming a wide stance. next, bend at the knees, not at the waist. and finally, lift with your arms and legs, not your back (see illustration, below). if you have to carry a heavy load when you\'re shopping, split it evenly between 2 shopping bags and carry one in each arm rather than carrying it all in front of you. ■ try to keep weight gain within the recommended parameters (see page give your feet a leg up 178). excess pounds will only add to the load your back is struggling under. ■ wear the right shoes. extremely high heels are a pain for your back-as are very unsupportive flat ones. experts recommend a chunky 2-inch heel, a low wedge, or flats with good arch support to keep your body in proper alignment. you might also consider orthotics, orthopedic shoe inserts designed for muscle support. as for those posture-improving shoes, some women find them helpful, while others find they increase back pain. wearing them may also exacerbate your off-balance factor. ■ sleep right. a comfortable sleeping position will help minimize aches and pains (see page 264). when getting out of bed, swing your legs over the side of the bed to the floor rather than twisting to get up. ■ consider belly support. think of it as support hose for your bump, designed to help take the burden of your belly\'s weight off your lower back and hips, helping relieve those aches and pains. belly-support garments come in stretchy bands and sleeves as well as in belts, slings, braces, and cradles-choose one that\'s comfortable for you (and works best under the kinds of clothes you wear, since some are belly smoothing and others are a little lumpy). whichever style you opt for, try not to wear your support band or belt 24/7. that\'s because with prolonged use of a belly support, your body will start to rely on it (instead of your abdominal and back muscles) to hold up your bump, resulting in further weakening of your core muscles and ultimately worsening back and hip pain. take steps to strengthen your back and core muscles with pregnancy-safe exercise (see page 239) so your belly band isn\'t doing all the work all the time. ■ no reaching for the stars-or the salad bowl you stored on the top shelf. minimize strain by using a low, stable step stool (or a taller friend) to retrieve items from high places. ■ alternate cold and heat to temporar- ily relieve sore back muscles. use a towel-wrapped ice pack for 15 minutes, followed by a towel-wrapped heating pad for 15 minutes. ask your practitioner before using heat patches (like salonpas or thermacare) directly on your skin. some recommend that you place such patches on your clothes instead of on your skin because they can get very hot-and very irritating to pregnancy-sensitive skin (definitely don\'t apply them to your belly). ask, too, before slathering on bengay, icy hot, or biofreeze creams for your pain. not all practitioners give the green light to these muscle soothers, especially in the last trimester. if yours does, go for it-but watch for signs of irritation (and don\'t use on your bump). arnica products (like traumeel) should not be used during pregnancy.","title" : "symptoms of anemia"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

therapeutic massage (with a massage therapist who knows you\'re pregnant and is trained in prenatal massage). ■ learn to relax. many back problems are aggravated by stress. if you think yours might be, try some relaxation exercises when pain strikes. also follow the suggestions beginning on page 145 for dealing with stress. ■ do simple exercises that strengthen your abs, such as the dromedary

only part of the pregnant body that\'s prone to expansion. if you\'re like many expectant moms, you\'ll discover that your feet are growing, too. good news if you\'re looking to revamp your entire shoe collection-not so good if you\'ve already sized out of your favorites and shopping for baby has left you cash crunched. what causes your feet to go through a growth spurt? while some expansion can be attributed to the normal fluid retention and swelling of pregnancy (or to new fat in your feet if your weight gain has been substantial or quick), there\'s another reason, too. relaxin, the pregnancy hormone that loosens the ligaments and joints around your pelvis so your baby can fit through the exit, doesn\'t discriminate between the ligaments you\'d want loosened up (like those pelvic ones) and those you\'d rather it just leave alone (like those in your feet). the result: when those ligaments in the feet loosen, the bones under them tend to spread slightly, often resulting in an added half or even a whole shoe size. though the joints will tighten back up again after delivery, it\'s possible that your feet will be permanently larger. in the meantime, try the tips for reducing excessive swelling (see page 312) if that seems to be your problem, and get a couple of pairs of shoes that fit you comfortably now and will meet your \"growing\" needs (so you won\'t end up barefoot and pregnant). when shoe shopping, put comfort before style-even if it\'s just this once. look for shoes with heels that are no more than 2 inches high and have both nonskid soles and plenty of space for your feet to spread out (shop for them at the end of the day when your feet are the most swollen). the shoes should be made from a material that will allow your swollen, sweaty dogs to breathe

your feet more comfortable but can reduce back and leg pain as well. getting off your feet periodically during the day can (obviously) help with swelling and pain, as can elevating (and periodically flexing) your feet when you get the chance. you can also try slipping on elasticized slippers while you\'re at home. wearing them for several hours a day may not make a great fashion statement-but it

stylist (and if you\'re really lucky, hair that is thicker and more lustrous). those pregnancy hormones trigger a surge in circulation and a boost in metabolism that nourish hair and nail cells,

belly? just as those pregnancy hormones caused the hyperpigmentation, or darkening, of the areolas, they are now responsible for the darkening of the linea alba, the white line you probably never

fair-skinned. it usually starts to appear during the second trimester and most often will begin to fade a few months after delivery (though it may never go away entirely-you may, in fact, wear traces of it into old age). interested in a round of guess-the-sex-of-my-baby? according to an old wives\' tale (not backed by science edition), if the linea nigra runs only up to the belly button, you\'re having a girl. if it runs past the navel up to the xiphoid process (near your ribs), it\'s a boy. mask of pregnancy (chloasma). these brownish-bluish-grayish discolorations appear in a masklike, confetti pattern on around 50 to 75 percent of moms-to-be, particularly those with darker complexions (since they have more pigment in their skin to start with), as well as those who have a genetic predisposition to it (if your mom had it, there\'s a good chance you\'ll have it, too). not a fan of the blotchy look? since exposure to sunlight can make chloasma worse, be faithful about applying sunscreen with an spf of at least 30, and avoid direct sun when possible. fill up on folic acid, too, since a folate deficiency can be related to hyperpigmentation. still blotchy? some moms-to-be strike back at the mask of pregnancy with homemade masks made from lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, or even mashed banana. no luck with those? never fear-chloasma usually fades within a few months after delivery. if it doesn\'t, a dermatologist can prescribe a bleaching cream or retin-a (but not while you\'re breastfeeding) or recommend another treatment (such as a laser or a peel). because those treatments are no-no\'s for now, bring on the concealer and foundation in the meantime. other skin hyperpigmentation. many women also find that freckles and moles become darker and more noticeable and that darkening of the skin occurs in high-friction areas, such as between the thighs. all this hyperpigmentation should fade after delivery. sun can intensify the discoloration, so use a sunscreen with an spf of 30 or more on exposed skin, and avoid spending long hours in the sun (even with sunscreen on). red palms and soles. it\'s your hormones at work again (plus an increase in blood flow), and they\'re causing red, itchy palms (and sometimes soles of the feet) in more than two-thirds of white women and one-third of women of color. there\'s no specific treatment, but some women find relief by soaking their hands and/or feet in cold water or applying an ice bag for a few minutes a couple of times a day. steer clear of anything that heats up your hands and feet (such as taking hot baths, washing dishes, wearing wool gloves). the dishpan look will disappear soon after delivery. bluish, blotchy legs. because of stepped-up estrogen production, many expectant women experience this kind of mottled discoloration on their legs (and sometimes their arms) when they\'re chilly. it comes and goes, is harmless, and will disappear postpartum. skin tags. a skin tag, which is essentially a tiny piece of excess skin, is another harmless (if annoying) skin complaint common in pregnant women. skin tags usually grow on areas of the body that are warmer and moister or are frequently rubbed by other skin or by clothing, including the folds of your neck, your armpits, your torso, beneath your breasts, or on your genitals. the (only) good news: they\'re completely benign and most will disappear after delivery. if your skin tags stick around, your doctor can remove them. heat rash. think babies when you think heat rash? think women expecting babies, too. caused by the combination of an already overheated pregnant body, dampness from all that extra perspiration, and the friction of skin rubbing against itself or against clothing (as it tends to do when there\'s more skin to rub), heat rash is both super common and super irritating among the expectant set. you can find it anywhere, but it\'s most likely to creep up in the crease between and beneath the breasts, in the crease where the bulge of the lower abdomen rubs against the top of the pubic area, and on the inner thighs. a cool, damp compress can take some of the heat out of your heat rash. patting on some cornstarch-based powder after your shower, wearing loose, breathable clothes, and trying to keep as cool as possible will help minimize discomfort and recurrence. a dab of calamine lotion can also be soothing and is safe to use, but check with your practitioner before you apply any other medicated lotions. if a rash or irritation lasts longer than a couple of days, ask your practitioner about next steps. tinea versicolor. tinea is a fungal infection that causes small, oval or round, flat, itchy, and flaky spots on the skin. the fungus causing the infection disrupts the normal pigmentation of the skin, resulting in discolored, scaly patches. it usually pops up on the oily parts of the body like the chest and back, but can appear anywhere. though it\'s not technically considered a pregnancy skin condition, it can appear for the first time during pregnancy or become exacerbated when you\'re expecting. treatment usually includes antifungal shampoos like head and shoulders (yes, on your body!) or antifungal creams, but be sure to ask your practitioner for a recommendation now that you\'ve got a baby on board. irritated skin rashes. often, rashes are triggered by pregnancy-sensitive skin reacting to a product you\'ve used prepregnancy without a reaction. switching to a gentler product often relieves these contact rashes, but still do let your practitioner know about any persistent rash. but wait, there\'s more. believe it or not, there are a host of other skin changes you might experience. for information on stretch marks, see page 190; acne, see page 166; itchy

scary part of this hairy situation during pregnancy (the part where you find hair in all the wrong places). some mamas-to-be find that the hair on their legs, underarms, or even eyebrows grows

parts that can fall prey to pregnancy hormones. not only can your vision seem less sharp, but your contact lenses, if you wear them, may suddenly feel uncomfortable. eye dryness, which is caused by a hormone-induced decrease in tear production, may be at least partially to blame for irritation and discomfort. another cause is extra fluid (it\'s everywhere!), that can change the shape of eye lenses-actually making some pregnant women more near- or farsighted. your vision should clear up and your eyes return to normal after delivery (so don\'t bother to get a new prescription unless the change is so pronounced that you really can\'t see well anymore). in case you were thinking about it, now isn\'t the time to consider corrective laser eye surgery. though the procedure wouldn\'t harm the baby, it could overcorrect your vision and take longer to heal, possibly requiring a second corrective surgery later on (plus the eye drops used aren\'t recommended for pregnant women). ophthalmologists recommend avoiding the surgery during pregnancy, in the 6 months preconception, and for at least 6 months postpartum (and if you\'re nursing, 6 months postweaning). though a slight deterioration in vision is not unusual in pregnancy, other symptoms do warrant a call to your practitioner. if you experience blurring or dimming vision or often see spots or floaters, or have double vision that persists for more than 2 or 3 hours, don\'t wait to see if it passes-call your practitioner at once. briefly seeing spots after you have been standing for a while or when you get up suddenly from a sitting position is fairly common and nothing to worry about, though you should report it at your next visit.","title" : "vision"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 130,"author" : "heidi

hiccup is simply one of pregnancy\'s biggest thrills (it sure beats heartburn and puffy feet). there may be no better proof that a brand-new-and impressively energetic-life is developing within you. but fetal movements can also drive a mom-to-be to distraction with questions and doubts: is my baby moving enough? too much? moving at all? one minute you\'re sure those were kicks you were feeling, the next you\'re second-guessing yourself (maybe it was just gas?). one day you feel your baby\'s twists and turns nonstop. the next day your little athlete seems to have been benched, and you barely feel a thing. not to worry. at this stage of pregnancy, concerns about your baby\'s movements-while understandable- are usually unnecessary. the frequency of noticeable movements at this point varies a great deal, and patterns of movement are erratic at best. though your baby is almost certainly on the move much of the time, you probably won\'t be feeling it consistently until he or she is packing a more powerful punch. some of those dance moves may be missed because of the fetal position (facing and kicking inward, for instance, instead of outward). or because of your own activity: when you\'re walking or moving about a lot, your baby may be rocked to sleep-or you may be too busy to notice the movements. it\'s also possible that you\'re sleeping right through your baby\'s most active period, which for many fetuses is in the middle of the night. (even at this stage, babies are most likely to kick up when their moms are lying down.) one way to prompt fetal movement if you haven\'t noticed any all day is to lie down for an hour or two in the evening, preferably after a glass of milk, orange juice, or a snack. the combination of your inactivity and the jolt of food energy may be able to get your fetus going. if that doesn\'t work, try again in a few hours, but don\'t worry. many moms-to-be find they don\'t notice movement for a day or two at a time, or even for 3 or 4 days, this early on. if you\'re still worried, call your practitioner for reassurance. after the 28th week, fetal movements become more consistent, and it\'s a good idea to get into the habit of checking on your baby\'s activity daily (see page 315).","title" : "fetal movement patterns"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 131,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'m going for my 20-week ultrasound, and we\'re not sure whether

way to play it. some parents opt for a heads-up on baby\'s gender for practical reasons: it makes layette shopping, nursery painting, and name selection (only one to pick!) a lot easier. others decide to get the baby gender bulletin early because they just can\'t stand the suspense. but a significant minority of parents still prefer to play the guessing game right up until the end-and to find out baby\'s sex the old-fashioned way, when his (or her) lower half finally makes its way into the world. the choice is yours. if you do decide to find out now, keep in mind that determining the sex of a baby through ultrasound is not an exact science (unlike amniocentesis, which determines the gender through chromosomal analysis). rarely, parents are told they\'re expecting a girl only to hear at delivery, \"it\'s a boy!\" (or far less often, the other way around-after all, it\'s easier to miss a penis than to see a penis where there isn\'t one). also occasionally, a baby won\'t cooperate with the gender reveal-instead, keeping those privates private with stubbornly crossed legs. so if you do choose to find out your baby\'s gender when you go for your ultrasound, remember that it\'s a very educated guess-but still, a guess. what if one of you wants to find out the sex and one of you doesn\'t? it\'s not easy to make that arrangement work (especially if the one who knows has problems keeping a poker face . . . or resisting hint dropping . . . or blurting out to friends and family), but it can be done. another choice you\'ll have to make if you opt to know the news: whether (and how, and when) to go public with it. some parents like to save their little secret as long as they can. others choose to live-stream the scan, making their discovery and their announcement simultaneously. still others decide to milk the momentous moment for all its worth, while celebrating with family and friends at the same time via a gender reveal (see box, facing page).","title" :

see how a baby is developing-and to offer reassurance that everything is going exactly the way it should be. one of its most exciting functions as far as many parents are concerned: it can give you the 411 on baby\'s sex, on a want-to-know basis, of course (that is, unless you\'ve already scored those results via an earlier chromosomal analysis). plus, it\'s fun to get a sneak peek at your baby-especially now that he or she actually looks like a baby! this more detailed scan will also give your practitioner additional valuable information about what\'s going on in that belly of yours. for example, it can measure the size of your baby and check all the major organs. it can measure the amount of amniotic fluid to make sure there\'s just the right amount, and evaluate the location of your placenta. in short, the second trimester ultrasound-besides being fun to watch-will give you and your practitioner a clear picture (literally) of the overall health of your baby and your pregnancy. eager to make some sense of what you\'re seeing on the screen? your cutie\'s beating heart will be easy to locate, but ask the sonographer to point out baby\'s face, hands, feet, and even some of those tiny but amazing organs, like the stomach and kidneys. routine second trimester ultrasounds are usually done in 2d-which will provide just a flat profile of baby\'s features, if a very cute one (suitable for framing, or uploading). most practitioners reserve the more detailed 3d (which takes multiple 2d images and pieces them together to form a 3d rendering that shows the whole surface, resembling a photo) and 4d scans (which shows baby moving in real time, like a video) to more closely examine a fetus for a suspected anomaly, such as cleft lip or spinal cord problems, or to monitor something specific that has to be seen more clearly. currently, these more sophisticated (and, admittedly fun-to-watch) scans are officially recommended only when they\'re considered medically necessary. that\'s because studies evaluating the safety of ultrasound technology show mixed results and as yet unclear potential risks. thinking about springing for an upgraded in-womb experience at

placentas are in the lower segment in the second trimester (and an even larger percentage before 14 weeks), the vast majority move into the upper segment by the time delivery nears. if this doesn\'t

with the baby behind it. and that, apparently, is what happened with your little bundle. happily, your baby doesn\'t care which side of the uterus he or she is lying on, and where the placenta is located certainly makes no difference to development. the downside for you is that you might be less able to feel those early kicks and punches because the placenta will serve as a cushion between your baby and your tummy-and that could lead to unnecessary worrying. for the same reason, your doctor or midwife may find it a bit harder to pick up your baby\'s heartbeat, especially early on (and it could make amniocentesis, if you need it, a little more challenging). but despite those slight inconveniences-which are no big deal-an anterior placenta is inconsequential. what\'s more, it\'s very

sleeping positions-on the belly and on the back-are not the best (and certainly not the most comfortable) choices during pregnancy. the belly position, for obvious reasons: as your stomach grows, it\'s like sleeping on a watermelon. the back position, though more comfortable, rests the entire weight of your pregnant uterus on your back, your intestines, and major blood vessels. this pressure can aggravate backaches and hemorrhoids, make digestion less efficient, interfere with optimum circulation, and possibly cause hypotension (low blood pressure), which can make you dizzy. the less-than-optimum circulation can also reduce blood flow to the fetus, giving your baby less oxygen and nutrients. it\'s not unsafe for your fetus if you find yourself on your back every once in a while, but being on your back for prolonged periods of time over weeks and months can be problematic. this doesn\'t mean you have to sleep standing up. curling up or stretching out on your side-preferably the left side, though either side is fine-with one leg crossed over the other and with a pillow between them (see illustration, below), is ideal for both you and your baby-to-be. it

body pillow that\'s at least 5 feet long or a wedge-shaped pillow can offer support, making side sleeping much more comfortable and staying on your side much easier. if you don\'t have either of these, you can improvise with any extra pillows, placing them against your body in different positions until you find that perfect combo for catching z\'s. or you can prop yourself in a semi-upright

on achievement at a too-tender age (and before birth is definitely too tender an age). fetuses (like the babies and children they\'ll become before you know it) develop-and later, learn-best at their own pace, no prodding necessary. there\'s also the chance that when parents attempt to turn the womb into a classroom, they may unknowingly disrupt the natural sleep patterns of their baby-to-be, hampering development instead of nurturing it (just as waking up a newborn for a game of name-this-letter might). that said, there\'s nothing wrong- and a lot right-with providing a uterine

your baby later. plus it feels good. so turn on the mozart, bring on the bach, pull out those dusty shakespeare sonnets (or pull them up online), and read away to your belly if you like- and if you can without cracking up. just make sure you\'re doing it all to get closer to your baby-not to get him or her closer to a spot in the school orchestra or an academic scholarship. of course, if you feel silly performing for your belly, there\'s no reason to worry that your baby will miss out on getting to know you. he or she is getting used to the sound of your voice- and dad\'s-every time you

supple and better able to stretch over your baby\'s head as he or she emerges (though perineal massage before labor will only be helpful if you\'re a first-timer). warm compresses on the perineum and perineal massage during labor may help avoid tearing. allowing the delivery to slow down and be controlled (pushing only when you feel the urge, not on a specific timetable) will give your perineum more time to stretch so it\'ll be less likely to tear. some practitioners suggest that delivering on all fours makes it less likely you\'ll tear, while squatting or lying flat on your back slightly

delivery. ? the placenta is oddly shaped or sepa- rates prematurely. ? fibroids prevent symmetrical con- traction of the uterus. ? the mother is very weak at the time of delivery (due to anemia, preeclampsia, or extreme fatigue, for example). ? the mother has been taking medi- cation or supplements that interfere with blood clotting (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, ginkgo biloba, or large doses of vitamin e). ? there is an undiagnosed genetic bleeding disorder in the mother (which is very rare). what are the signs and symptoms? the symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage include: ? bleeding that soaks through more than 1 pad an hour for several hours in a row ? heavy, bright red bleeding for more than just a few days ? passing very large clots (lemon size or larger); smaller clots are normal ? pain or swelling in the lower abdom- inal area beyond the first few days after delivery the loss of large amounts of blood can make a woman feel faint, breathless, or dizzy, or cause her heart to speed up. what can you and your practitioner do? you should expect bleeding titioner immediately if you notice abnormally heavy bleeding or any of the other symptoms listed above during the first postpartum week. if the bleeding is severe enough to be categorized as hemorrhage, you may need iv fluids or possibly even a blood transfusion. can it be prevented? after the placenta is delivered, your practitioner will examine it to make certain that it\'s complete-that no part of it might have remained in your uterus (which could lead to excessive bleeding or infection). he or she will probably give you pitocin (oxytocin) or other medication and may massage your uterus to encourage it to contract to minimize bleeding. breastfeeding (if you will be nursing) as soon as possible will also help your uterus contract, minimizing bleeding. avoiding any supplement or medication that may interfere with blood clotting will also reduce the possibility of excessive postpartum bleeding.","title" : "postpartum hemorrhage"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 144,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "what is it? the vast majority of new moms recover from delivery without any problems at all, but childbirth can occasionally leave you open to infection. that\'s because it can leave you with a variety of open wounds-in your uterus (where the placenta was attached), in your cervix, vagina, or perineum (especially if you tore or had an episiotomy, even if it was repaired), or at the site of a c-section incision. postpartum infections can also occur in your bladder or kidney if you were catheterized. a fragment of the placenta inadvertently left behind in the uterus can lead to infection, too. but the most common postpartum infection is endometritis, an infection of the lining of the uterus (the endometrium). while some infections can be dangerous, especially if they go undetected or untreated, most often infections simply make your postpartum recovery slower and more difficult, and they take time and energy away from your most important priority: getting to know your baby. for that reason alone, it\'s important to get help for any suspected infection as quickly as possible. how common is it? as many as 8 percent of deliveries result in an infection. women who had a cesarean delivery or those who had premature rupture of the membranes are at greater risk. what are the signs and symptoms? symptoms of postpartum infection vary, depending on where the infection is, but there\'s almost always: ? fever ? pain or tenderness in the infected area ? foul-smelling discharge (from the vagina in the case of a uterine infection, or from a wound) ? chills what can you and your practitioner do? call your practitioner if you\'re running a postpartum fever of 100�f for more than a day; call right away if the fever is higher or if you notice any of the other symptoms above. if you have an infection, you\'ll probably receive a prescription for antibiotics (one that\'s breastfeeding-friendly if you\'re nursing). take it as prescribed for the entire course, even if you begin to feel better. taking probiotics when you\'re on the course of antibiotics (though spaced at least 2 hours apart) may prevent associated diarrhea, vaginal yeast infection, or thrush (in you or your baby, if you\'re breastfeeding). you should also try to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. can it be prevented? meticulous wound care and cleanliness after delivery can definitely help prevent infection (wash your hands before touching the perineal area, wipe from front to back, and use only maxipads-not tampons-for postpartum bleeding). a l l a b o u t:","title" : "postpartum infection"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 145,"author" : "heidi

turning in your gym membership for a while, maybe it\'s staying in bed for at least half the day, every day-and maybe it\'s a hospital stay for the last few weeks (or months) of your pregnancy. no matter what form it takes (or what it\'s called) it\'s estimated that bed rest is still being prescribed in about 20 percent of pregnancies in the u.s. that number may be waning, but probably not as quickly as many practitioners, many pregnant patients, and even acog would like. so has this time-honored prescription for many problem pregnancies timed out? probably not. there are still a number of reasons why a practitioner might recommend a restriction of activities, but probably the simplest rationale is that practitioners often have no other treatment options open when trying to prevent complications like preterm birth-and yet, they feel compelled to \"do something.\" certain moms-to-be are more likely to wind up on some kind of bed rest, including those who are over 35 (because they\'re generally more at risk of pregnancy complications), as well as those who are carrying multiples, have a history of miscarriage due to cervical insufficiency, who have pregnancy bleeding (such as in a threatened miscarriage), have particular pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, have certain chronic conditions, or have threatened preterm labor.","title" : "if you\'re put on bed

with a list of very specific can-dos and definitely don\'t-dos. that\'s because bed rest comes in a variety of packages. here\'s the basic lowdown on each type of bed rest. be sure to talk over the options with your practitioner if you\'re being put on any form of bed rest-to make sure it\'s not stricter than it needs to be. scheduled resting (or activity restriction). in the hopes of preventing full bed rest later, some practitioners ask moms-to-be with certain risk factors (such as multiples or a previous preterm delivery) to rest for a prescribed amount of time every day. the recommendation may be to sit with your feet up or lie down for 2 hours at the end of every workday or rest for an hour, lying down on your side (left preferably, but either side is fine), for every 4 hours that you\'re awake. some practitioners may ask you to simply shorten your workday in your third trimester and restrict activities such as exercise, stair-climbing, and walking or standing for extended lengths of time. modified bed rest. with modified bed rest, you\'re generally prohibited from working in the office (though working from the comfort of home is probably okay), driving, and doing household chores (now, that\'s something to celebrate!). sitting up (possibly with your feet up) is probably fine, as is standing just long enough to make yourself a sandwich or take a shower. you may even be granted one outing per week, as long as it doesn\'t involve a long walk or any stairs. you\'ll also be able to go to your monthly (or even weekly, if necessary) practitioner appointment. moms-to-be on modified bed rest may split their day between the couch or recliner and the bed, but going up or down stairs will be kept to a minimum. light physical therapy may be prescribed. strict bed rest. this usually means you need to be horizontal all day except for bathroom trips and a brief shower (using a shower chair if possible). if there are stairs in your house, you\'re going to have to pick a floor and stay there. (some women will be allowed to make a round-trip between floors once a day, for others it might be just once a week.) strict bed rest means no kitchen privileges, so unless you\'ll have someone around to serve up meals and snacks, you\'ll need a mini-fridge or cooler by your bed. light physical therapy may also be prescribed at home. hospital bed rest. some moms-to-be require constant monitoring, which means hospital admission. and just by the nature of being in the hospital, you\'ll be spending a lot more time in bed. however, given concerns about prolonged inactivity, if you\'re prescribed hospitalization, you may also be prescribed light physical therapy during your stay-a good thing, since it\'ll keep your muscles working in a way that\'s safe for you and your baby. if you\'ve","title" : "what kind of rest?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 147,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "been sent to bed? check this list before you crawl under the covers. ? check in with your health insurance company. let your health plan know you\'ve been put on bed rest (and submit the right medical forms from your practitioner if necessary). ask what home care, if any, will be covered. ask, too, if you might be covered for physical therapy, medical supply rental, or even massage. you can also inquire about your coverage in case your baby is born prematurely. ? file for disability insurance. bed rest can have enormous financial impact on a family that\'s about to expand (another reason to be sure it\'s truly necessary as prescribed). if you won\'t be able to work, speak to someone in the hr department (if there is one) at your workplace to see if you qualify for short term disability coverage (you should, though you and your practitioner will have to document the reasons why)-and whether your bed rest \"time off\" from work will cut into your fmla coverage (see page 200), if you are entitled to any. ? explore work-at-home options. if your job and your employer are flexible, you may be able to continue working at least part-time while on bed rest. or if your job doesn\'t allow this, perhaps you can look into opportunities that do. ? load up your phone. make sure you\'ve updated your contact info with numbers you may need while you\'re stuck in bed (your practitioner, the pharmacy, the hospital, neighbors and friends who can help you in a hurry). ? create online or app accounts for restaurant delivery, grocery and drugstore delivery, online concierge services, dog walker services, laundry services, and so on, and let the deliveries begin-finances permitting. ? hire help, if possible. or enlist help from family, friends, and neighbors who have offered. you\'ll need a hand with light cleaning, errands, babysit-ting (if you have other children at home), carpooling (if you have older kids who need to get to school, activities, and play dates), meal prep, and laundry. if your friends and neighbors have offered to help, suggest they use online tools to keep things organized, such as lotsahelpinghands.com, carecalendar.org, or mealbaby.com. ? give people who you\'ll want visiting access to your keys (or leave a key with a neighbor, the apartment manager, or doorman) so you don\'t have to get out of bed each time the doorbell rings. if possible, arrange to have a neighbor accept deliveries. ? purchase or borrow a mini fridge that can be placed next to your bed (or couch) and stocked with drinks, cut up veggies, cheese, yogurt, and other snacks that need to stay chilled. or consider a cooler lined with ice packs and restocked daily. ?

move what you can. your practitioner may allow-and in fact prescribe- some low-impact exercise (walks, light weights for your upper body, resistance bands for your lower body) to minimize muscle loss and maintain your strength. ? stretch what you can. as much as you can under your practitioner\'s guidelines, stretch your legs, circle your ankles, and flex your feet to help prevent blood clots and keep your muscles strong. raise and lower your arms, do shoulder rolls, do chest expansions (lace your fingers behind your back and open your chest), and so on to keep up your strength in your upper body. and don\'t forget those kegels, which you can do even if you\'re sent to bed. ? monitor what you eat. a significant dip in a mom\'s appetite can lead to weight loss for her and a lower birth-weight for her baby-so if you find yours slacking, fight back by grazing on nutritious snacks. of course, if you find yourself eating too much (out of boredom or depression), excessive weight gain might also become an issue-so keep an eye on nonstop nibbling, and make sure you have healthy snacks handy. ? stay hydrated. it\'s easy to remember to drink water when you\'re active (say, after a run), but it\'s hard to work up a thirst in bed. getting enough fluids helps minimize swelling and constipation, which are both compounded by moving less. to bed for most or part of the day, maximize blood flow to your uterus by lying on your side, not your back, and change sides every hour or so to lessen body aches and prevent bed sores. put a pillow under your head, a body pillow under your belly and between your knees, and perhaps a pillow behind you (a regular one or a specially designed one for propping), if that helps you to balance. staying propped up in bed (especially after eating) also helps ease heartburn. mentally. living with limitations on your activity can be hard to handle- especially if you\'re normally a very active person. sometimes keeping yourself busy can provide a welcome distraction. try to: ? stay connected. of course, you\'ll want to stay in touch with family and friends via phone, text messaging, videochatting, and social media-if only so you can vent to those who love you most. but you may find the most empathy and support from those who are also sitting out pregnancy-your fellow bed-resters. you can find them on whattoexpect.com (and don\'t forget to go app happy with the what to expect app). or check out the box on page 581 for a list of other online resources for women going through high-risk pregnancies. ?

grab your weights and do some chest flies while she does her light bicep curls. encourage her to bicycle her legs (if that\'s allowed) or do foot flexes while you do some spinning on the stationary bike next to her. do sit-ups in bed next to her while she\'s doing her neck rolls. ask her \"in\" for a date. she may not be able to get out to a dinner and a movie, but you can bring the date night home (or to the hospital room). dress up (even if it\'s just your best pj\'s), put on some dinner music, bring out the candles and the nice dishes, and have her favorite restaurant deliver (or cook her favorite meal). it may not have the same ambience she remembers from your nights out, but it\'ll be a welcome respite from the daily waiting game. treat her. if it\'s in your price range, or is covered by insurance, bring in a massage therapist for a prenatal rub down ? stream some shows. two words: binge watch. ? get crafty. knit, crochet, scrapbook, or quilt (if you don\'t know how, turn to a youtube tutorial or a crafty friend). you\'ll keep busy while creating keepsakes for your little one. ? organize. clean up your laptop and your phone once and for all, catch up on software and app updates, upload (just make sure it\'s cleared by her practitioner). see if a local nail salon will agree to a house call and (finances permitting) book her a mani-pedi. if that\'s out of your financial league or not up her alley, give her a back rub, do facials together at home (find an online recipe for one that\'s made from ingredients you probably have at home, like oatmeal or avocado), or offer to paint the toes she can no longer reach. talk her up. just about every expectant mom could use an extra boost for her confidence, but mamas-on-bed-rest can benefit from even more sweet talking. yes, you always think she\'s beautiful and sexy, even when she hasn\'t washed her hair in days or put on makeup in weeks, but does she know you think that? let her know . . . as often as you can. lend your shoulder and your ear. sometimes, she\'ll need to vent, and most times, you\'ll be on the receiving end of her frustrations. for best results (and because she deserves it), respond with patience, understanding, and empathy. talk her up (or talk her down when she\'s feeling on the ledge)-remind her she\'s beautiful, strong, and your own personal hero, and that this too shall pass (leaving you both with a cuddly prize package for her efforts)-but also let her unload as much as she needs to. as you attend to her emotional needs, however, try not to ignore your own entirely. be sure to take a break yourself now and then (that\'s what the rotating schedule of visitors is for) and lean on your buddies for support, too. being on bed rest is hard-but so is being the care provider for someone on bed rest. watch her mood. being stuck on bed rest is linked to an increased risk of pregnancy depression and anxiety disorder. be alert to the signs (see page 174) and if you notice them, take the steps necessary to get her the help she needs. be alert, too, to the signs of postpartum depression (see page 498), since pregnancy bed rest increases that risk as well. is your mood worrying you? depression can hit expectant and new dads, too. check in with your doctor and make sure you get the help you need. help her bounce back. think that after all that rest, she\'ll be ready to run new-baby marathons when it\'s over? actually, the opposite will be true. the longer she has spent on restricted activity, the more deconditioned she\'ll become-and the less energy and stamina she\'ll have. which means she\'ll actually be more tired than the average new mom, not more refreshed, and that she\'ll likely need more help during her postpartum recovery, not less. give her that help, as well as the time she needs to get back her strength-but remember that both of you can expect to feel pretty drained for a while, thanks to your new parent positions. photos into a digital frame. create a baby announcement list, and design your e-card or paper birth announcement. make sure you have all the addresses (or email addresses) ready to roll. you can even print out address labels in advance, if you\'re pretty sure you won\'t want to handwrite them. order stamps while you\'re at it. ? socialize. throw a pajama party- order in pizza or have your friends bring over a potluck. and if you can\'t go out for your baby shower, ask your friends to throw it at your house. ? primp and polish. try not to fall into the \"nobody\'s going to see me anyway\" trap. looking good makes you feel good, whether anyone sees you or not. so brush your hair, put on makeup, slather your tummy in yummy-smelling lotion (your skin might be itchy and dry anyway), treat yourself to a diy facial or mani. if you can afford it, consider having a mobile hairstylist or manicurist make a house call. (drop the hint to your friends that this would make a great shower gift.) ? start a journal. now\'s a great time to begin recording your thoughts in an online journal or in the what to expect pregnancy journal and organizer. or consider writing a few letters to your baby, to preserve pregnancy moments you can share with your child years later. have some feelings about bed rest you\'d like to vent? you can journal those, too. ? be a mommy-to-be blogger. always wanted to write? now\'s your chance. ? keep your eyes on the prize. frame one of your ultrasound pictures, and keep it by your side or put it on your phone or tablet as your wallpaper-so when the going gets tough, you can remind yourself that you have the best reason in the world not to go anywhere at all.","title" : "handling bed rest"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 151,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "wondering how bed rest will affect the rest of your family, from your partner to other children (including your furry ones)?

a miscarriage is the loss of an embryo or fetus before it is able to live outside the uterus, resulting in the unplanned end of a pregnancy. when such a loss happens in the first trimester, as it does 80 percent of the time, it\'s called an early miscarriage. (a miscarriage that occurs between the end of the first trimester and week 20 is considered a late miscarriage; see page 589.) an early pregnancy loss is often related to a chromosomal or other genetic defect in the embryo, but it can also be caused by hormonal and other factors. most often, the cause can\'t be identified. miscarriage is not caused by exercise, sex, working hard, lifting heavy objects, a sudden scare, emotional stress, a fall, or a minor blow to the abdomen, and it isn\'t triggered by even the most severe morning sickness. how common is it? early miscarriage is far more common than most women realize. though it\'s hard to know for sure, researchers have estimated that over 40 percent of conceptions end in miscarriages. but since well over half of miscarriages occur so early that a woman doesn\'t even know she\'s pregnant yet, they often go unnoticed, passing for a normal or sometimes heavier period. see the box on page 584 for more on the different types of early miscarriage. signs and symptoms. the symptoms of a miscarriage can include some or all of the following: ? cramping or pain (sometimes severe) in the center of the lower abdomen or back ? heavy vaginal bleeding (possibly with clots and/or tissue) similar to a period ? light staining continuing for more than 3 days ? a sudden pronounced decrease in or loss of the usual signs of early pregnancy, such as breast tenderness and nausea (not the normal, gradual diminishing as the first trimester comes to a close) ? a cervix that appears open (dilated) when examined by the practitioner ? no embryo visible on ultrasound (the sac is empty) ? no heartbeat detected on ultrasound what can you and your practitioner do? if your practitioner finds that your cervix is dilated and/or no fetal heartbeat is detected on ultrasound (and your dates are correct), it means that you are having a miscarriage or have already had one. sadly, nothing can be done to prevent the loss at this stage. if

official medical name. still, it\'s helpful to know about the different types of miscarriage so you\'re familiar with the terms your practitioner might be using. chemical pregnancy. a chemical pregnancy occurs when an egg is fertilized but fails to develop successfully or implant fully in the uterus. a woman may miss her period and suspect she is pregnant-she may even have a positive pregnancy test because her body has produced some low (but detectable) levels of the pregnancy hormone hcg. but in a chemical pregnancy, there will be no gestational sac or placenta, and the pregnancy ends in what seems like a period. experts estimate that up to 70 percent of all conceptions are chemical, and many women who experience one don\'t even realize they\'ve conceived. often, a very early positive pregnancy test and then a late period (a few days to a week late) are the only signs of a chemical pregnancy. blighted ovum. a blighted ovum (or anembryonic pregnancy) refers to a fertilized egg that attaches to the wall of the uterus and begins to develop a placenta (which produces hcg), but then fails to develop into an embryo. what is left behind is an empty gestational sac (which can be seen on an ultrasound). experts believe that up to half of all early miscarriages are blighted ovums. most blighted ovum miscarriages occur very early in the first trimester. some even occur before a woman realizes she\'s conceived, and end in what seems like a late period. others are only noticed during a routine early ultrasound, when (after weeks 5 or 6) a gestational sac is visible but there is no embryo inside it. from your uterus. bleeding following the procedure usually lasts no more than a week. though side effects are rare, there is a slight risk of infection following a d&c. how should you and your practitioner decide which route to take? some factors you both can take into account include: ? how far along the miscarriage is. if bleeding and cramping are already heavy, the miscarriage is probably already well under way. in that case, allowing it to progress naturally may be preferable to a d&c. but if there is no bleeding yet (as in a missed miscarriage), misoprostol or a d&c might be better alternatives. ? how far along the pregnancy is. the farther along the pregnancy is, the more fetal tissue there will be, and the more likely a d&c will be necessary to empty your uterus completely. ? your emotional and physical state. waiting for a natural miscarriage to occur after an embryo or fetus has died in utero can be psychologically debilitating. it\'s likely that you won\'t be able to begin coming to terms with-and grieving for-your loss while the pregnancy is still inside you. completing the process faster will also allow you to resume your menstrual cycles soon, and when and if the time is right, to try to conceive again. missed miscarriage. a missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus dies but isn\'t expelled, at least not right away. often there are no signs initially (no bleeding, for instance), and in some cases the placenta continues to produce hormones, which makes your body think you\'re still pregnant. a missed miscarriage is usually discovered during a routine first trimester ultrasound when there is no heartbeat detected, or later on in the first trimester when the heartbeat can\'t be heard with doppler. the fact that there are no warning signs-you come to your appointment expecting to see or hear the heartbeat and there isn\'t one-can make the realization all the more painful. some women notice the loss of all existing pregnancy symptoms (though that in and of itself doesn\'t mean that the pregnancy is lost), and less commonly, experience a brownish discharge. complete miscarriage. a complete miscarriage is when all the pregnancy tissue (embryo and placenta) passes from the uterus through the vagina. the woman experiences bleeding and cramping, and the miscarriage completely empties the uterus without any medical intervention. on examination, the practitioner finds that the cervix has reclosed, and there is no sign of a pregnancy sac in the uterus on ultrasound. the earlier the miscarriage occurs (usually those earlier than 12 weeks), the more likely it is to be a complete one. incomplete miscarriage. an incomplete miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus is no longer viable and passes through the vagina via bleeding along with some of the tissue from the placenta, but some pregnancy tissue stays inside the uterus. with an incomplete miscarriage, a woman continues to cramp and bleed (sometimes heavily) and her cervix remains dilated. because there is some remaining placental tissue in the uterus, it continues to produce hcg, which is detectable in blood tests and doesn\'t fall as expected. the remaining tissue in the uterus is also still visible on an ultrasound. ? risks and benefits. because a d&c is invasive, it carries a slightly higher (though still very low) risk of infection. the benefit of having the miscarriage complete sooner, however, may greatly outweigh that small risk for some women. with a naturally occurring miscarriage, there is also the risk that it won\'t completely empty the uterus, in which case a d&c may be necessary to finish what nature has started. ? evaluation of the miscarriage. when a d&c is performed, evaluating the cause of the miscarriage through an examination of the fetal tissue will be easier. if this isn\'t your first miscarriage, genetic testing can be performed on the tissue as well, which can help predict the likelihood of recurrence, as well as provide some measure of closure. if you miscarry naturally and feel able (physically and emotionally, and both might be extremely difficult) to save the expelled pregnancy, you can do this in a sterile cup or small storage container, so that it can be tested later. no matter what course is taken, and whether the ordeal is over sooner or later, the loss will likely be difficult for you. see page 592 for help in coping.","title" : "types of early miscarriage"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 158,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "what is it? a molar

are most often miscarried. so while a 20-year-old\'s odds of losing a pregnancy are 10 to 15 percent, a 35-year-old has a 20 percent chance of miscarrying, a 40-year-old has a 40 percent chance, and a 45-year-old\'s risk of pregnancy loss is over 80 percent. when a woman conceives through advanced reproductive techniques like ivf (which women over 40 are more likely to do), the risks of miscarriage can be lowered (though not eliminated) through preimplantation screening, which stacks the odds of a healthy pregnancy by implanting only those embryos that appear healthy and viable. 35, as well as

that implants outside the uterus, most commonly in a fallo-pian tube, usually because something (such as scarring in the fallopian tube) obstructs or slows the movement of the fertilized egg into the uterus. an ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the cervix, on the ovary, or in the abdomen. unfortunately, there is no way for an ectopic pregnancy to continue normally. ultrasound can detect an ectopic pregnancy, often as early as 5 weeks. but without early diagnosis and treatment of an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg might continue to grow in the fallopian tube, leading to a rupture of the tube. if the tube bursts, its ability in the future to carry a fertilized egg to the uterus is destroyed, and if the rupture is not cared for, it can result in severe, even life-threatening, internal bleeding and shock for the mother. luckily, quick treatment (usually surgery or medication) can help avoid such a rupture and removes most of the risk for the mother while greatly improving the chances of preserving her fertility. how common is it? about 2 percent of all pregnancies are ectopic. women at risk of having an ectopic pregnancy include those with a history of endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, a prior ectopic pregnancy or tubal surgery, and women who smoke, have an std, or conceived while using progesterone-only birth control pills. an iud doesn\'t increase the

options for birth control?\" okay, maybe sex isn\'t the first thing on your minds these days-and these sleep-deprived nights. maybe it\'s the last thing on your mind most of the time. yet there will come a night (or a sunday afternoon when baby\'s napping) when you\'ll get the urge to sweep the pacifiers and burping cloths off the bed and sweep each other off your feet-when lust will return to your life, and passion will pick up where it left off (approximately) pre-baby. so be prepared. if you\'d like to avoid back-to-back pregnancies, you\'ll need to use some form of birth control as soon as you begin having sex again. and because you never know when the urge might strike, it\'s good to have that birth control in hand (or by your bed) well in advance. unless you\'re a gambling twosome, counting on breastfeeding to provide birth control is dicey (see previous question). in other words, you\'ll want to consider a more reliable form of birth control-and there are plenty to choose from, even if you\'re a breastfeeding mom. there might even be some new options on the market since the last time you picked a birth control method (or ones that better fit your needs now). before you decide on which form of contraception is best for you, read up on all the following methods, and discuss them with your partner and your practitioner. each of the methods has its benefits and drawbacks, depending on your medical and gynecological history, your lifestyle, whether you want to become pregnant again in the future (and how certain you want to be about avoiding pregnancy in the meantime), your practitioner\'s recommendation, and your feelings and your partner\'s. all of these methods are effective when used correctly and consistently, though some offer more reliable results than others: oral contraception. available in most states by prescription only (a few states allow over-the-counter sales), oral contraception (oc or \"the pill\") is among the most effective nonpermanent methods of birth control, with a success rate of about 99.5 percent (most failures are due to a user\'s missing a day or taking pills in the wrong order). another plus: it allows for spontaneity in sex. there are two basic types of oral contraception: combination pills (which contain both estrogen and progestin) and progestin-only pills (mini-pills). both work by preventing ovulation and by thickening cervical mucus to keep sperm from reaching an egg, should one be released. they also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. the combination pills are slightly more effective in preventing pregnancy than the minis. for maximum effectiveness, the mini-pills must be taken at the same time every day (combination pills have a slightly longer window). some women experience side effects from oc (which vary, depending on the pill), most commonly: fluid retention, weight changes, nausea, breast tenderness, an increase or decrease in sex drive, hair loss, and menstrual irregularities. after the first few cycles of pill use, side effects often diminish or disappear completely. in general, today\'s oral contraceptives trigger fewer side effects than oc did years ago. some versions of the pill (yasmin, cyclessa) deliver constant levels of estrogen and a new type of progestin (these are called monophasic pills) or use three different levels of estrogen and progestin (called triphasic) to reduce bloating and pms. another option that may be especially appealing to women who aren\'t fond of their monthly flow is seasonale. it comes in a package with 84 hormone pills and 7 inactive pills; women take the hormones for 12 weeks straight before taking a break for their period (which then comes only 4 times a year). some women, however, experience more breakthrough bleeding with seasonale than with monthly pills. most doctors agree that it\'s safe to take any monophasic pill continually-by skipping the inactive pills-to avoid having a monthly period altogether. women who are over age 35 and heavy smokers may be at increased risk of serious side effects (such as blood clots, heart attack, or stroke) from oc. the pill may also be unsuitable for women with certain medical conditions, including a history of blood clots, diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancer. and oc sometimes is less effective in overweight or obese women. on the plus side, oc appears to protect against a whole host of conditions, including ovarian and uterine cancer. other benefits experienced by some women who take oc are diminished pms, very regular periods, and (with certain varieties) clearer skin. there is some controversy about whether oc affects your breast cancer risk, so talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have, especially if there\'s a family history of premenopausal breast cancer. if you\'re planning to have another baby, fertility may take longer to return if you\'re using oc than if you\'re using a barrier contraceptive. ideally, you should switch to a barrier method (see page 515) about 3 months before the time you plan to start ttc (trying to conceive). about 80 percent of women ovulate within the first 3 months after stopping the pill, 95 percent within a year. if you decide to try oc (or go back to it), your doctor will help you determine which type and which dose is best for you, based on whether you\'re breast-feeding (oral contraception containing estrogen is not recommended during breastfeeding, so nursing moms are limited to a progestin-only pill, aka the mini-pill), as well as on your menstrual cycle, weight, age, and medical history. making sure the pill works the way it\'s supposed to is up to you-so take it as prescribed. if you miss even one pill, or if you have diarrhea or vomiting (which can interfere with absorption of oc by your body), use backup protection (such as a condom) until your next period. see your doctor every 6 months to 1 year for monitoring of your health, report any problems or signs of complications that show up between visits, and be sure to inform anyone prescribing medication of any kind that you are on oral contraception (some herbs and medications, such as antibiotics, interact adversely with oc, making it less effective). the pill doesn\'t protect against stds, so use a condom, too, if there\'s a chance of contracting an std from your partner. oc increases the need for b6, b12, c, riboflavin, zinc, and folic acid (it reduces the need for other nutrients), so continue taking your prenatal (or a breastfeeding supplement) while on the pill. injection. hormonal injection, such as depo-provera, is a highly effective method of birth control (with a success rate of 99.7 percent) that stops ovulation and thickens cervical mucus to keep sperm and egg from meeting. the shot, given in the arm or buttock, is effective for 3 months. depo-provera is a progestin-only injection, so it is safe for breastfeeding mothers. as with oral contraception, side effects of hormonal injections can include irregular periods, weight gain, and bloating. for some women, periods become fewer and lighter, and many women will have no periods while using depo-provera. other women might experience longer and heavier periods. and, like oc, the shot is not for every woman, depending on her specific health and medical condition, and it doesn\'t protect against stds. the greatest advantage to the shot is that it prevents pregnancy for 12 weeks, and this can be compelling for someone who doesn\'t like to have to think about birth control or who often forgets to take a pill or insert a diaphragm. it also protects against endometrial and ovarian cancers. but there are disadvantages, too: having to return to your practitioner every 12 weeks for another shot, the fact that the effects of the shot can\'t be immediately reversed (if you suddenly want to ttc), and that it may take up to a year for fertility to return after you stop depo-provera. patch. the ortho evra patch, a matchbox-size adhesive patch, delivers the same hormones as the combination pill but in patch form. unlike oc, the patch maintains a steady state of hormonal levels because it continuously delivers hormones through the skin. the patch is worn for 1 week at a time and is replaced on the same day of the week for 3 consecutive weeks (you can use an app or an alarm on your phone as a reminder). the 4th week is \"patch free,\" during which you\'ll get your period. the patch can be changed any time of the day. if you forget to change the patch and leave it on beyond the 7 days, the hormones are still effective for an additional 2 days. most women choose to wear the patch on the abdomen or bottom. it can also be worn on the upper torso (excluding the breasts), the back, or the upper outer arm. since the patch isn\'t affected by moisture, humidity, temperature, or activity, it can be worn in any weather, when showering or working out, even in a sauna or hot tub. like other hormonal contraceptives, the patch is highly effective (about 99.5 percent). it may be less effective in overweight or obese women. side effects are similar to those of oc, but there may be a greater risk of blood clots with the patch. it does not protect against stds. ring. the nuvaring is a small (about the size of a silver dollar), transparent, flexible plastic ring that can flatten like a rubber band, be inserted into the vagina, and left in place for 21 days. once inserted, the ring releases a steady flow of low doses of estrogen and progestin. the exact positioning of the ring inside the vagina isn\'t a key to effectiveness because it\'s not a barrier method of birth control. you can easily insert the ring yourself once a month (you won\'t feel it once it\'s inserted, and neither will your partner during sex). once you remove it (again, easily), you\'ll get your period. then 1 week after the last one was removed, you\'ll insert a new ring, even if your period hasn\'t stopped yet. if you\'re likely to have trouble remembering the monthly insertion, a calendar reminder or app can keep you on track. studies show that the level of cycle control with the nuvaring is better than that with oc, which means there\'s little breakthrough bleeding. because the hormones are the same as those used in the combination pills, side effects are generally the same, and those women who are advised not to use oc are also advised not to use contraceptive rings. the ring is also not for breastfeeding mothers. it has a success rate of about 99 percent, and is a good choice for obese women. the nuvaring does not protect against stds. implant. the under-the-skin progestin implant has been shown to be a safe and effective method of birth control (with a success rate of about 99.9 percent), though the method may be less effective in obese women. nexplanon is a single flexible plastic rod about the size of a matchstick that is implanted under the skin of the upper arm. it releases a low, steady dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus, as well as stop ovulation. the implant is safe during breastfeed-ing, and it can prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years. the most common side effect is irregular bleeding-especially in the first 6 to 12 months of use. most women find their periods become fewer and lighter (though some have longer, heavier periods), and some women stop having periods completely. serious problems with nexplanon are rare. it does not protect against stds. iud (intrauterine device). the iud is the most widely used reversible birth control method for women in the world, but not so in the u.s., where only 11 percent of women using contraception opt for it. which is surprising, since today\'s iuds are considered among the safest methods of birth control-and are as effective as sterilization (over 99 percent). they\'re also the most convenient, and, for most women, trouble free-definitely worth considering. an iud is a small plastic device that is inserted into a woman\'s uterus by her gyn provider, and can be left in place (effectively preventing pregnancy) for a number of years, depending on the type of iud. there are two types of iuds. the paragard copper iud releases copper in the uterus to immobilize sperm, and also prevents implantation. this long-lasting iud can be left in for 10 years (talk about set it and forget it!). the mirena iud releases progestin into the uterine walls, thickening cervical mucus and blocking sperm, while also preventing implantation. it lasts for 5 years-still a pretty good chunk of protected time. the major advantage of an iud is that it offers the ultimate in convenience. once it is inserted (which, by the way, can happen any time you\'d like, including right after your vaginal or cesarean delivery, or at your 6-week postpartum checkup), it needs absolutely no maintenance, except to check regularly (monthly is a good idea) for the string attached to it. this allows for a completely spontaneous sex life-with no pausing to find and insert a diaphragm or put on a condom, or remembering to take a daily pill. another plus: the iud does not interfere with breastfeeding, and the hormones in the mirena are safe for a breastfeeding baby. you can increase the already excellent protection from pregnancy provided by the iud if you use condoms and/or spermicides for the first 2 or 3 months after insertion (when most failures, which are rare to begin with, occur). the iud should not be used by a woman who has untreated gonorrhea or chlamydia. it should also not be used by a woman with active pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy or premalignancy, or abnormalities of the uterus or an unusually small uterus. ask your doctor about the safety of an iud if you (or your partner) have an std. an allergy or suspected allergy to copper rules out the use of a copper iud. possible complications include cramping (which can be mild to moderate) during insertion (and, rarely, for a few hours or even days following), uterine perforation (extremely rare), accidental expulsion (it might go unnoticed and leave you unprotected), and tubal or pelvic infections (also rare). having an iud in place does not increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. some women may experience spotting between periods during the first few months after insertion. the first few periods may also last longer and be heavier. it\'s also not unusual for a woman to continue having heavier and longer periods while using an iud, though the progestin-releasing mirena may lessen the amount of bleeding (most women find their periods get lighter or disappear completely with the mirena). keep in mind that iuds don\'t protect against stds. diaphragm. the diaphragm is a barrier method of birth control-a dome-shaped rubber cap that\'s placed over the cervix before sex to block the entry of sperm. it\'s 94 percent effective when used properly (meaning, it\'s the right size, it\'s inserted properly, and it doesn\'t slip) along with a spermicidal gel, meant to inactivate any sperm that might slip past the barrier. aside from possible increases in urinary tract infections and an occasional allergic reaction triggered by either the spermicide or the rubber, the diaphragm is safe. in fact, used with a spermicide, it appears to reduce the risk of pelvic infections that can lead to infertility (though it doesn\'t protect against stds). it in no way affects breastfeeding. with the diaphragm, size absolutely matters. it must be prescribed and fitted by a medical professional-and refitted after every delivery, since pregnancy and childbirth change the size and the shape of the cervix. as for the spontaneity factor, the diaphragm doesn\'t exactly get high marks-you have to stop to insert it (or insert it before things get started), then check to make sure it\'s properly inserted before each sex session (unless you\'ll be having an encore sexual performance within a few hours, in which case you just need to add more spermicide). the diaphragm then has to be left in place for at least 6 to 8 hours after sex (but no longer than 24 hours in a row). some experts suggest it\'s probably prudent to remove it within 12 to 18 hours, and some recommend women insert their diaphragms as part of their bedtime routines so they don\'t forget or neglect to use it in a moment of passion (though again, it can\'t be kept in place for more than 24 hours at a time). either way, there\'s a lot of keeping track and clock-watching. and there\'s maintenance involved, too-cleaning the diaphragm after use, storing it properly in its case (not loose in the bottom of your purse or in your jeans pocket), and checking it regularly for holes by holding it up to a light. cervical cap. the cervical cap is similar to the diaphragm in many ways. it must be fitted by a medical professional, must be used with a spermicide, and does its job by acting as a barrier to sperm. its success at preventing pregnancy is lower than the diaphragm\'s (approximately 60 to 75 percent), but it does offer a couple of advantages. shaped like a large thimble, the pliable rubber cap has a firm rim that fits snugly around the cervix, making it only about half the size of the diaphragm. a convenience plus: instead of the 24-hour outside limit recommended for the diaphragm, the cap can be left in place for 48 hours (though an unpleasant odor can develop when it\'s left in that long). the femcap, another type of cervical cap (with a success rate of 85 percent), is a silicone dome shaped like a sailor\'s hat. it comes in three sizes and fits over the cervix with a brim that seals against the vaginal walls and has a groove that stores the spermicide and traps the sperm. it also has a removal strap. vaginal sponge. the today sponge, which covers the cervix and blocks sperm from entering the uterus while also continuously releasing a spermicide that keeps sperm from moving, is made of plastic foam. it is soft, round, and about 2 inches in diameter with a nylon loop attached to the bottom for removal. the upsides to the sponge: it doesn\'t require a visit to the doctor or a prescription, is relatively easy to use, provides continuous protection for a full 24 hours after insertion, and has no effect on breastfeeding. on the downside, it\'s somewhat less effective than the diaphragm (about 80 percent), can increase the risk of yeast infections, and can be uncomfortable to insert. it should not be left in longer than recommended, and you\'ll need to check carefully to make sure the whole sponge is removed intact (a piece left behind could cause odor and infection). the sponge also can\'t be reused, so you\'ll have to stay stocked up. condom. also called a rubber, a condom (as you probably know) is essentially a penis cover designed to trap sperm when they\'re ejaculated so they can\'t gain access into the vagina. it\'s made of latex or natural skin (from the intestines of a sheep)-and if used consistently and correctly, it\'s a pretty effective birth control method (with a success rate of 98 percent). the condom is totally harmless-that is, unless one or both partners has an allergic reaction to the latex material or the spermicide (if latex is an issue, opt for the natural skin). it has the advantage of being easily available and portable (for on-the-fly activities), and of reducing the risk of transmitting stds, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hiv (the latex variety is better at preventing transmission of hiv), as well as the zika virus. because it in no way interferes with breast-feeding and because it clearly doesn\'t require postpartum refitting (as does the diaphragm), it is an ideal \"transitional\" method. some couples find that condoms get in the way of spontaneous fun-especially because you have to wait until erection to put it on-and some find it decreases sensitivity and/ or causes vaginal irritation (with more potential for irritation postpartum). other couples don\'t mind condoms a bit, and may even find a way to make putting it on part of foreplay. to increase effectiveness, you shouldn\'t linger long after sex when you\'re using a condom-the penis should be withdrawn before the erection is totally lost and while the condom is held on, to avoid leakage of semen. the use of a lubricating cream (or a lubricated condom) will help slip the covered penis in more comfortably during those dry postpartum and breast-feeding months. but choose your lube with care: don\'t use oil-based lubricants or vaseline, because they can damage a latex condom (always check the instructions on the package before using an oil-based lubricant). thought condoms kept only guys covered? there\'s one for you, too. the female condom is a thin, lubricated polyurethane pouch that lines the vagina and is held in place by a closed inner ring near the cervix and an outer open ring at the opening of the vagina. a female condom is inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse and is removed right after. the downsides to the female condom: it is more expensive than the male condom, may prevent full sensation, and is clearly noticeable once in place. plus, it\'s yet another birth control method that depends on a woman\'s compliance, unlike the male condom, which at least shares the load. and it\'s a little less effective than the male condom (about 95 percent). but like the male condom, it prevents stds. spermicide foams, creams, jellies, suppositories, and contraceptive films. used alone, these antisperm agents are only so-so effective (approximately 72 to 94 percent) at preventing pregnancy. they are available without a prescription, but can be messy and inconvenient. they can be inserted up to 1 hour before intercourse. emergency contraception. the emergency contraception pill (ecp) is the only method of birth control that can be used after unprotected sex (or as backup when your contraceptive method has failed, as with a broken condom, slipped diaphragm, or missed pills) but before a pregnancy is established. ecp is sold over-the-counter as plan b one-step, take action, next choice one dose, and my way. ella, another ecp, is available with a prescription. ecps reduce a woman\'s risk of pregnancy by 75 percent when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. the sooner ecps are taken after unprotected sex, the more effective they are. (your doctor might also recommend using ordinary birth control pills as emergency contraception, but check to confirm the dose you should use.) emergency contraception pills will not work if you\'re already pregnant. important distinction: ecp is not a so-called abortion pill, like ru486. ecps work primarily by temporarily stopping ovulation. ecps are not recommended for use during the first 6 weeks postpartum because their high estrogen content can increase the risk of blood clots and are not recommended while breastfeeding. sterilization. sterilization is frequently the choice of couples who feel that their families are complete, don\'t have a problem with closing (and locking) the door to conception, and are eager to dispense with contraception altogether (and who\'s not eager for that?). it\'s increasingly safe (with no known long-term health effects) and virtually foolproof. the occasional failure can be attributed to a slip-up in surgery or, in the case of vasectomy, not using alternative birth control until all viable sperm have been ejaculated. though sterilization is sometimes reversible, it should be considered permanent. a vasectomy (the tying or cutting of the vasa deferentia, the tubes that transport sperm from testicles to penis) is an easy, in-office procedure done with local anesthesia, and it carries far fewer risks than female sterilization. it doesn\'t (as some men fear) affect the ability to achieve erection or ejaculate-all that\'s missing is the sperm (not the semen). research has also shown that there is no increased risk of prostate cancer for men with vasectomies. tubal ligation is a procedure done on women under regional or epidural anesthesia (right after delivery if you want; see page 439) in which a small incision is made in the abdomen (near the belly button or bikini line) and the fallopian tubes are cut, tied, or blocked. it does require some downtime, usually 2 days to a week (sometimes more) of only light activity for most women- which you\'re going to be adhering to anyway if you just delivered. another permanent birth control option for women is called essure. an alternative to tubal ligation, this type of sterilization doesn\'t require an abdominal incision (as tubal ligation does). a soft, flexible microinsert is placed into each fallopian tube via a catheter (tube) inserted through the cervix. over the course of 3 months, new tissue grows in the fallopian tube (inside the insert), blocking the tubes completely. a backup method of birth control must be used until the doctor can confirm through testing that your tubes are effectively blocked (usually after 3 months). sounds pretty perfect, but this method isn\'t without controversy. the fda is investigating reports that the procedure may cause pain, bloating, and heavy bleeding. fertility awareness. couples who pre- fer not to use contraception at all can opt for the fertility awareness method (fam), aka natural family planning. this approach relies on becoming aware of a number of body signs or symptoms to determine the time of ovulation. if done perfectly correctly, the fam approach can be just as successful at avoiding pregnancy as some other birth control methods (in the 90 percent effectiveness range). so what makes for perfect practice of fertility awareness? the more factors a couple takes into consideration, the better the success rate-and there\'s a long list of factors, including cervical mucus changes (the mucus is clear, copious, thin, has an egg-white consistency, and can be pulled into a long string at ovulation), basal body temperature changes (the baseline temperature, measured first thing in the morning, drops slightly just before ovulation, reaches its lowest point at ovulation, and then immediately rises to a high point before returning to the baseline for the rest of the cycle), and cervical changes (the normally firm cervix becomes a little softer, and it\'s also slightly higher and more open than normal during ovulation). ovulation predictor kits can also help to pinpoint ovulation (though using them every month to prevent pregnancy can get pretty pricey). saliva tests for ovulation can also help some women predict when ovulation is about to happen and are more cost effective. once you\'re armed with all the ovulation information you need, the key will be avoiding sex from the first sign that you\'re about to ovulate until 3 days after. need more ovulation information? see what to expect before you\'re expecting. a l l a b o u t:","title" : "birth control

for a newborn, that kind of activity won\'t tighten up the perineal and abdominal muscles that have been stretched and left saggy by pregnancy and childbirth-only a regular workout program will. and the right kind of postpartum exercise will do more than tone you up. it will help keep baby-toting backaches at bay, promote healing and recovery from labor and delivery, help pregnancy-loosened joints tighten up, and improve circulation. kegel exercises, which target the perineal muscles, will help you avoid stress and urinary incontinence and postpartum sexual problems. finally, exercise can make you happier. as exercise-released endorphins circulate in your system, boosting your mood and your ability to cope, you\'ll find yourself much better equipped to handle the stresses of new parenthood, and even beat back baby blues. in fact, research shows that moms who resume exercising within 6 weeks of delivery feel better about themselves-and just plain feel better. don\'t even think about starting off with a bang, however, even if you feel surprisingly well and mega-motivated. instead, ease your recovering body slowly and steadily back into workout mode with the following basic exercises. supplement these with an online or dvd postpartum workout, take a class for new moms, or just make daily strolls (or strollercize) with baby a part of your daily routine.","title" :

your 9 months of expecting (a little morning sickness, a few leg cramps, some heartburn and fatigue), but maybe you weren\'t expecting to come down with a nasty cold or an ugly (and itchy) infection. the truth is, pregnant women can get sick with the best of them-actually, even better than the best of them, since the normal suppression of the immune system (so mom\'s body doesn\'t reject her baby as \"foreign\") makes expectant moms easier targets for germs of every variety. what\'s more, being sick for two can make you at least twice as uncomfortable-especially since so many of the remedies you\'re used to reaching for may need to stay behind medicine cabinet doors for now. prevention is, of course, the best way to avoid getting sick in the first place and to keep that healthy glow of pregnancy going strong. but when it fails (as when a coworker brings a stomach bug to the office, your nephew\'s wet kisses are sweet but saturated with cold germs, or you pick up some bacteria with

your baby can\'t catch your cold or be affected by it in any way. the not-so-good news: the medications and supplements that you might be used to reaching for to find relief (or to prevent a cold), including ibuprofen, extra doses of vitamin c and zinc, and herbals (like echinacea), are usually off limits when you\'re expecting (see page 538 for information on taking medications during pregnancy). so before you pick the shelves of your local drugstore clean, pick up the phone and call your practitioner to find out which over-the-counter remedies are considered safe in pregnancy, as well as which will work best in your case. (if you\'ve already taken a few doses of a medication that isn\'t recommended for pregnancy use, don\'t worry. but do check with your practitioner for extra reassurance.) even if your standard cold remedy is shelved for now, you don\'t have to suffer with a runny nose and hacking cough. some of the most effective cold remedies don\'t come in a bottle and are also the safest for both you and your baby. these tips can help nip a cold in the bud, before it blossoms into a nasty case of sinusitis or another secondary infection, while helping you feel better faster. at the very first sneeze or tickle in the throat: ? rest, if you need it. taking a cold to bed doesn\'t necessarily shorten its duration, but if your body is begging for rest, be sure to listen-especially now that it\'s begging for two. on the other hand, if you feel up to it (and you\'re not running a fever or coughing), light to moderate exercise can actually help you feel better faster. ? feed your cold, and your baby. eat as well as you can, given how crummy you feel and how little appetite you probably have. especially seek vitamin-c-rich foods, like citrus and melon. ? flood your cold with fluids. a runny nose can cost your body fluids you and your baby need. warm fluids (like ginger tea or chicken broth) will be particularly soothing for your scratchy throat. ? stay up even when you\'re lying down. elevating your head with a couple of pillows will make it easier for you to breathe through a stuffy nose. nasal strips (which gently pull your nasal passages open, making breathing easier) may help, too. or try decongesting with a vapor rub, like vicks. ? stay moist. keeping your nasal pas- sages moist will ease congestion, so run a humidifier, especially at night, and use saline nasal spray (it\'s drug free, so you can use it as often as needed) or saline rinses (but steer clear of neti pots, since they\'re more apt to spread germs). ? soothe with salt water. gargling with warm salt water (� teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water) can ease a sore or scratchy throat, wash away postnasal drip, and help control a cough. ? calm a dry cough the sweet way. a couple of teaspoons of honey can actually suppress the kind of dry cough that often comes with and after a cold as effectively as an otc cough syrup. honey\'s too sweet straight up? mix it with hot water and lemon. colds don\'t typically come with a fever, but if your temperature rises to over 100�f, bring it down promptly with acetaminophen (tylenol) and call your practitioner (see page 527 for more on fever). also call if your cold is severe enough to interfere with eating or sleeping, if you\'re coughing up greenish or yellowish mucus, if you have a cough with chest pain or wheezing, if your sinuses are throbbing (see the next question), or if symptoms last more than 10 to 14 days. it\'s possible that your cold has progressed to a secondary infection and that prescribed medication may be needed.","title" : ""}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 176,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'ve had a bad cold for more than 10 days. now my forehead and cheeks are starting to

worsening stuffy nose, signs of sinusitis often include pain and tenderness in the forehead and/or one or both cheeks (beneath the eye), achiness around the teeth, and possibly a temporary loss of the sense of smell. the pain of sinusitis usually worsens when you bend over or shake your head. fever sometimes accompanies these symptoms, but not always. sinusitis following a cold is fairly common, but it is far more common among pregnant women. that\'s because pregnancy hormones tend to swell mucous membranes (including those in and leading to the sinuses), trapping air and mucus behind the narrowed sinus openings, and causing blockages that allow germs to build up and multiply in the sinuses. these germs tend to linger longer there, because immune cells, which destroy invading germs, have difficulty reaching the sinuses\' deep recesses. as a result, the symptoms can persist for weeks (or longer, becoming chronic). most sinus infections are caused by viruses (sometimes they\'re caused by allergies), but about 10 percent of the time bacteria get the blame. if your sinus infection is caused by bacteria (often the case when your sinus symptoms are lingering for longer than 10 days or if they\'re severe and accompanied by fever), your practitioner will prescribe a pregnancy-safe antibiotic to clear it up. if your sinusitis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won\'t be helpful, so treatment will focus on easing symptoms with pain relievers, nasal steroids, and nasal rinses (some practitioners will okay limited use of certain decongestants after the first trimester;

smart move. in fact, the cdc recommends that all moms-to-be get the flu shot. that\'s because the flu can be much more severe when you\'re expecting, and is more likely to lead to serious complications requiring hospitalization. and since the cdc puts pregnant women at the top of the priority list (along with the elderly and children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years), moms-to-be can waddle to the front of the flu-shot line, even if the vaccine is in short supply. talk to your practitioner about getting a flu shot-many ob practices offer it to pregnant patients. you can also stop by a flu shot clinic at your local pharmacy or supermarket. the flu vaccine offers the most protection if it\'s given before or early in each flu season (preferably by october). it\'s never 100 percent effective, because it protects only against the flu viruses that are expected to cause the most problems in a particular year. still, it greatly increases the chance that you will escape the season flu-free (and h1n1-free, too). and even when it doesn\'t prevent the flu, the vaccine usually reduces the severity of symptoms-which is extra important when you\'re expecting, since flu can hit pregnant women especially hard. side effects occur infrequently and are generally mild. in case you were wondering, you\'ll have to stick with the needle when it comes to your seasonal flu vaccine, since the nasal spray vaccine (flumist, which is made from live flu virus), is not approved for or given to pregnant women. if you suspect you might have the flu (symptoms include fever, achiness, headache, sore throat, and cough), call your doctor right away so that you can be treated (and so that the flu doesn\'t progress to pneumonia). treatment may include an antiviral medication (like tamiflu) along with steps aimed at reducing fever (see next question) and other symptoms.","title" : "flu season"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 178,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" :

"\"i\'m afraid i have a urinary tract infection.\" your poor battered bladder, which spends months on end being pummeled by your growing uterus and its adorable occupant, is the perfect breeding ground for less welcome visitors: bacteria. those little bugs (which usually live quietly in your skin and in your feces) have an easier-than-usual time entering your urinary tract when you\'re expecting, thanks to the flood of muscle-relaxing hormones. once there, bacteria make themselves at home and make you miserable-multiplying fast in areas where compression from your expanding uterus (the same compression that has you getting up to pee several times a night) has allowed urine to pool or flow slowly. in fact, urinary tract infections (utis) are so common in pregnancy that at least 5 percent of pregnant women can expect to develop at least one, and those who have already had one have a 1 in 3 chance of an encore. in some women, a uti is \"silent\" (without symptoms) and diagnosed only after a routine urine culture. in others, symptoms can range from mild to quite uncomfortable (an urge to urinate frequently, pain or a burning sensation when urine-sometimes only a drop or two-is passed, pressure or sharp pain in the lower abdominal area). the urine may also be foul smelling and cloudy. diagnosing a uti is as simple as dipping a stick into a urine sample at your practitioner\'s office-the stick will react to red or white blood cells in the sample, both of which can indicate an infection. the urine will then be sent off to the lab for further analysis. treating a uti is simple, too. your practitioner will prescribe a course of pregnancy-safe antibiotics specifically targeting the type of bacteria the lab finds in your urine. of course, prevention is always the best strategy-but especially when you\'re expecting. here are some steps you can take to prevent a uti-you can also use them, in conjunction with your prescribed treatment, to help speed your recovery from an infection: ? drink plenty of fluids, especially water, which can help flush out any bacteria. cranberry juice may also be beneficial, possibly because the tannins it contains keep bacteria from sticking to urinary tract walls. avoid coffee and tea (even decaffeinated), which may increase irritation. ? wash your vaginal area well and empty your bladder just before and after sex. ? every time you urinate, take the time to empty your bladder thoroughly. leaning forward on the toilet will help accomplish this. it sometimes also helps to \"double void\": after you pee, wait 5 minutes, then try to pee again. and don\'t put off the urge when you have it, since regularly holding it in increases susceptibility to infection. ? to give your perineal area breathing room, wear cotton-crotch underwear and panty hose, avoid wearing tight pants or leggings, don\'t wear panty hose or tights under pants, and sleep without panties or pajama bottoms on if possible (and comfortable). ? keep your vaginal and perineal areas meticulously clean and irritation-free. wipe front to back after using the toilet to keep fecal bacteria from entering your vagina or urethra. wash daily (showers are better than baths), and avoid bubble bath and perfumed products: powders, shower gels, soaps, sprays, detergents, and toilet paper. ? ask your practitioner about taking probiotics to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria. utis in the lower part of the urinary tract are no fun, but a more serious potential risk is that bacteria from an untreated uti will travel up to your kidneys. kidney infections that aren\'t treated can be quite dangerous and may lead to premature labor, low birth-weight, and other complications. the symptoms are the same as those of utis but are frequently accompanied by fever (often as high as 103�f), chills, blood in the urine, backache (in the midback on one or both sides), nausea, and vomiting. if you experience these symptoms, notify your practitioner immediately so you can be treated promptly.","title" : "urinary tract infection"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 182,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i think i

you can catch a break before you begin pushing; see box, page 429). pushing and delivery generally take between 30 minutes and an hour, but can sometimes be accomplished in 10 (or even fewer) short

may still have trouble recognizing the onset of each contraction. what you may be feeling. common in the second stage (though you\'ll definitely feel the following a lot less-and you may not feel

tremendous rectal pressure (ditto) ? very visible contractions, with your uterus rising noticeably with each ? an increase in bloody show ? a tingling, stretching, burning, or stinging sensation at the vaginal opening as your baby\'s head crowns (it\'s called the \"ring of fire\" for good reason) ? a slippery wet feeling as your baby emerges emotionally, you may feel relieved, exhilarated, and excited that you can now start pushing-or, if the pushing stretches on for much more than an hour, frustrated or overwhelmed. in a prolonged second stage, you may find your preoccupation is less with seeing the baby than with getting the ordeal over with (and that\'s perfectly understandable). some moms can also feel inhibited or unsure when they begin pushing, especially if they don\'t quite get the hang of it at first. after all, birthing a baby is a natural process-but it doesn\'t always come naturally. what you can do. it\'s time to get this baby out. so get into a pushing position (which one will depend on the bed, chair, or tub you\'re in, what\'s most comfortable and effective for you, and your practitioner\'s preferences). a semi-sitting or semi-squatting position is often the best because it enlists the aid of gravity in the birthing process and may offer you more pushing power. tucking your chin to your chest when you\'re in this position will help you focus your pushes where they need to be. sometimes, if the pushing isn\'t mov- you\'ve been semi-sitting, for example, you might want to get up on all-fours. once you\'re ready to begin pushing, give it all you\'ve got. the more efficiently you push and the more energy you pack into the effort, the more quickly your baby will make the trip through the birth canal. frantic, disorganized pushing wastes energy and accomplishes little-plus it can take its toll on you. keep these pushing pointers in mind: ? relax your upper body and your thighs and then push as if you\'re having a bowel movement (the biggest one of your life). focus your energy on your vagina and rectum, not your chest (which could result in chest pain after delivery) and not your face (straining with your face could cause bruises on your cheeks and bloodshot eyes, not to mention do nothing to help get your baby out). it may help to look down, past your bump, as you push. ? speaking of bowel movements, since you\'re bearing down on the whole perineal area, anything that\'s in your rectum may be pushed out, too-trying to avoid this while you\'re pushing can slow your progress. don\'t let inhibition or embarrassment break the pushing

to help her. if she slips out of position, gently help her back into it. ? periodically point out her progress. as the baby begins to crown, remind her to keep an eye on the mirror so she can have visual confirmation of what she is accomplishing. when she\'s not looking, or if there\'s no mirror, give her inch-by-inch descriptions. take her hand and touch baby\'s head together for renewed

while identical twins usually happen by chance, your chance of having fraternal twins (the more common type of twin) increases based on the following factors (some of which can also influence the odds of having higher-order fraternal multiples, too): age. the older you are, the higher your odds of having fraternal twins. moms over the age of 35 are naturally more likely to drop more than 1 egg at ovulation (thanks to often higher levels of fsh, or follicle-stimulating hormone), upping the odds of having twins. fertility treatments. as techniques in assisted fertility become more sophisticated, they\'re less likely to produce multiples, especially higher-order multiples. still, having any kind of fertility treatments (particularly the kind that stimulates ovulation or implants more than 1 embryo) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy. obesity. women who are obese when they conceive (with a bmi higher than 30) are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower bmis. size. there is some evidence that larger, taller women may be slightly more likely to conceive twins than smaller women-but the connection appears weak (meaning size doesn\'t matter much). race. twins are slightly more common among african americans and somewhat less common among hispanics and asians. family history. do fraternal twins run in your family?

use a reminder-a notation in your breastfeeding journal or app, a small scrunchie looped around your bra strap, or a nursing bracelet on your wrist-to remind you which breast is on deck for the next feed. and speaking of keeping track, it\'s a good idea to keep a running tab of baby\'s feeds (when they begin and end) as well as of wet and soiled diapers your newborn produces. while that might sound a bit obsessive, it\'ll help give you a good sense of how breastfeeding is going, and also make it possible for you to report back to baby\'s doctor at the next checkup. along with good weight gain, adequate output (at least 6 wet diapers-with urine that\'s clear, not dark-and at least 5 bowel movements over each 24-hour period) is one of the best indications of good intake-and a sign that your breasts and baby are right on target. get calm, mom. tension not only inhibits letdown (how your breasts dispense milk once it\'s on tap), but it can generate stress in your baby (infants are extremely sensitive to mom\'s moods)- and a stressed-out baby can\'t nurse effectively. so try to start out each feed as relaxed as possible. do some relaxation exercises before you begin, or tune in to some soft, soothing music. getting comfortable will also help you get your calm on, so use a nursing pillow (or a regular pillow) to position baby so breastfeeding\'s not a strain or a pain. bring on baby\'s calm before feeds, too, by doing some gentle rocking and quiet, soothing skin-to-skin.","title" : "feeding time"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 211,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "p roper positioning is essential to a good latch, and to prevent nipple soreness and other breastfeeding problems. start by placing baby on his or f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "breastfeeding 101"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 212,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "i t\'s a biological fact: there are three things that moms can do that dads can\'t. you can\'t be pregnant, you can\'t give birth (some would consider that a definite plus), and you can\'t breastfeed. but here\'s another fact: those natural physical limitations don\'t have to send you to the sidelines. you can share in nearly all the excitement, joy, anticipation, and, let\'s face it, stress of your spouse\'s pregnancy, labor, and delivery- from the first kick to the last push-as an active, supportive participant. and though you\'ll never be able to put your baby to the breast (at least not with the kind of results baby\'s looking for), you can share in the feeding process: be your baby\'s backup feeder. once breastfeeding is established, there\'s more than one way to feed a baby. and though you can\'t breastfeed, you can be the one to give supplementary bottles of expressed milk or formula (if those will be on baby\'s menu). not only will being the supplementary feeder give mom a break (whether in the middle of the night or in the middle of dinner), it will give you extra opportunities for closeness with your baby. make the most of the moment-instead of propping the bottle up to the baby\'s mouth, strike a nursing position, with your baby snuggled close and the bottle where that breast would be. opening up your shirt, which allows for cuddly skin-to-skin contact, will enhance the experience for both of you. no supplementary bottles on the menu? you can still do skin-to-skin, every chance you get. share the night shift. sharing in the joys of feeding also means sharing in those early weeks of sleepless nights. even if you\'re not giving supplementary bottles, there\'s plenty you can do for team feed. you can be the one to pick baby up, do any necessary diaper changing, deliver baby to mom for feedings, and return baby to the crib or bassinet once the feed is finished. not only will you be connecting more with baby by participating in nighttime feeds (building both lifelong bonds and lifetime memories), but you\'ll also be letting mom get some much-needed rest. double down on other duties. breastfeeding is the only baby-care activity limited to moms. dads can bathe, diaper, and rock with the best of moms-and yes, even better than them-given the chance to step up and step in. her side, facing your nipple. make sure baby\'s whole body is facing your breasts-with his or her ear, shoulder, and hip in a straight line. in other words, make sure baby\'s little boy or girl parts are facing (parallel to) the breast you\'re not feeding from. you don\'t want your baby\'s head turned to the side-it should be straight in line with his or her body. (imagine how difficult it would be for you to drink and swallow while turning your head to the side.) use a nursing pillow (or a regular pillow) to bring baby up to a height that will make maneuvering your little one to the breast easier. you can try any of these positions, experimenting to find the ones that feel most comfortable for you: crossover hold. hold your baby\'s head with the hand opposite to the breast you\'ll be nursing from (if nursing on the right breast, hold your baby with your left hand). rest your wrist between your baby\'s shoulder blades, your thumb behind one ear, your other fingers behind the other ear. using your other hand, cup your breast, placing your thumb above your nipple and areola at the spot where your baby\'s nose will touch your breast. your index finger should be at the spot where your baby\'s chin will touch the breast. lightly compress your breast so your nipple points slightly toward your baby\'s nose. you are now ready to have baby latch on. football hold. this position, also called the clutch hold, is especially useful if you\'ve had a c-section and want to avoid placing your baby against your abdomen, or if your breasts are large or if your baby is small or premature. position your baby at your side, facing you, with baby\'s legs under your arm (your right arm if you\'re nursing on the right breast). support your baby\'s head with your right hand and cup your breast as you would for the crossover hold. cradle hold. position your baby so that sweet little head rests in the bend of your elbow and you\'re using the rest of your arm to support baby\'s body. using your free hand, cup your breast as you would for the crossover hold. laid-back position (\"biological nur- turing\"). lean back on a bed or couch, football holdcrossover hold well supported by pillows, so that when you put your baby tummy-to-tummy onto your body, head near your breast, gravity will keep him or her molded to you. your baby can rest on you in any direction, as long as his or her whole front is against yours and he or she can reach your breast. your baby can naturally latch on in this position, or you can help by directing the nipple toward his or her mouth-but otherwise you don\'t have to do much in the laid-back position besides lie back and enjoy. side-lying position. in this position, both you and your baby lie on your sides, tummy to tummy. use your hand on the side you\'re not lying on to cup your breast if you need to. this position is a good choice when you\'re feeding in the middle of the night. now that baby\'s in position, you can latch him or her onto your breast using the following tips: ? gently tickle your baby\'s lips with your nipple until his or her mouth is opened very wide, like a yawn. some lcs suggest aiming your nipple toward your baby\'s nose and then directing it down to the upper lip to laid-back position side-lying position cradle hold get baby to open his or her mouth very wide. this prevents the lower lip from getting tucked in during nursing. if your baby turns his or her head away, gently stroke the cheek on the side nearest you. the rooting reflex will make baby turn his or her head toward your breast. ? once that little mouth is opened wide, move your baby closer. do not move your breast toward your baby. many latching-on problems occur because mom is hunched over baby, trying to shove breast into mouth. instead, keep your back straight and bring your baby to your breast. remember, too, not to stuff your nipple into an unwilling mouth-instead, let your baby take the initiative. it might take a couple of attempts before your baby opens his or her mouth wide enough to latch on properly. ?

an obvious-and big- advantage of tandem-nursing is that you don\'t spend all day and night nursing (first baby a, now baby b, and back to baby a, and so on). to nurse two at the same time, position both babies on the pillow first, and then latch them on (or ask someone to hand the babies to you one at a time, especially while you\'re still getting used to the juggling act). using a nursing pillow designed for twins will make positioning much easier. you can position both babies in the football (or clutch) hold, using nursing pillows to support their heads, or you can combine the cradle hold and the football hold, again using the pillow for support and experimenting until both you and your babies are comfortable. if tandem nursing doesn\'t appeal to you, don\'t do it. you can bottle-feed one (using either pumped milk or formula, if you\'re supplementing) while nursing the other (and then switch off), or nurse one baby after the other. got three (or more) babies to feed?

how soon you can get baby to latch on and get busy depends on how you\'re feeling and how baby\'s doing. more and more hospitals are allowing skin-to-skin (and breast nuzzling) time right after delivery, baby\'s condition permitting. and the most progressive hospitals are giving new moms the opportunity to breastfeed right after their c-section-while they\'re still in the operating room. of course you\'ll have a hard time moving (you just had major surgery after all), so be sure to enlist your partner, a nurse, your doula, or an lc to help you get propped up (or shifted to your side) and in position, ready for baby to be handed to you. you\'ll probably find breastfeeding after a c-section uncomfortable at first (at least once your pain meds wear off). your best bet will be to find a position that puts the least amount of pressure on your incision. do this by placing a regular or breastfeeding pillow on your lap under the baby, or by lying on your side, or by using the football hold (page 482), again supported by a pillow, to nurse. a belly band can also take some of the pressure off your incision, helping make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. some positions will be more comfortable than others, so be sure to find the best one for you. if you\'re groggy from general anesthesia or your baby needs immediate care in the nursery, this first nursing session may have to wait. if after 12 hours you still haven\'t been able to get together with your baby, ask about using a pump to express colostrum and get lactation started. a few more things to keep in mind: first, since you\'ve been pumped up with a lot of fluids thanks to your iv, your baby will have a little more \"water weight\" on him or her. your little one will get rid of those fluids by peeing a lot and appearing to lose a lot of weight (more than a typical vaginal birth baby). be sure that normal weight loss isn\'t used as a reason to give a supplementary bottle (unless it has been prescribed as medically necessary), since that could hurt your chances of early breastfeeding success (see page 479). second, some moms who have had a cesarean delivery find that their milk comes in a little later than expected, probably due to the extra stress of surgery. you can keep your milk supply on track by cuddling skin-to-skin with your baby often and getting those first nursing sessions started as soon as possible. be sure you\'ve documented your wishes in your birth plan and that you\'ve got advocates on your side (your partner, an lc, a doula, the pediatrician) helping you be reunited with your baby as soon as possible. finally, you\'ll be given pain meds (often narcotics) after your delivery-don\'t hesitate to take them if you need them (and want them). being in intense pain can unnecessarily interfere with your breastfeed-ing efforts. as long as you use them only short-term and at a safe dose (take only one tablet every 6 to 8 hours maximum, and watch for excessive drowsiness in baby), they\'re safe for your little one and compatible with breastfeeding. if you\'ve been given antibiotics after your c-section, be aware that it might increase your newborn\'s chances of getting thrush. taking a probiotic can help reduce that risk.","title" : "breastfeeding after a cesarean delivery"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 215,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "b reast is best for babies of every size-including the tiniest ones. in fact, preemies and babies who are small for gestational age or have other medical problems at birth do much better on breast milk, even if they\'re not ready to tackle a breast. so don\'t give up on breastfeeding. talk to your baby\'s neonatologist and the nurse in charge to see how you can best feed your very little one-and feed him or her the very best-while in the nicu. and then, if you can, get pumping (a double electric is best, and if you can rent a hospital grade pump, better still). if baby isn\'t ready for latching on yet, your pumped milk may be given to your baby via tube feeding or bottle. even if that\'s not possible at first, you can pump milk to store until baby\'s ready for it-and to keep your supply pumped up until baby\'s ready to feed from you directly. can\'t produce enough breast milk or can\'t pump at all?

tone that tummy. ease into some undemanding exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your back (see page 520 for more). ? get support. use a belly binder, belt, or band to help support your abdominal muscles, easing back pain. ? mend when you bend. and lift. give your back a break by bending properly: spread your feet apart to give yourself a wide base of support, bend at your knees (not your waist), tighten your core as you lift (or lower), lift using your leg muscles, and hold the object as close to your body as you can. if an object is too heavy or awkward, don\'t lift it. ? get off your feet. sure, you\'re run- ning (and rocking) all the time, but whenever you don\'t have to, take a seat. when you have to stand, place one foot on a low stool to take some pressure off your back. ? put your feet up. who deserves to put their feet up more than you? plus, elevating your feet slightly when sitting-and baby feeding-will ease the strain on your back. ? don\'t be a slouch on the couch. when feeding your baby, don\'t slump over (as tempting as that might be, given your state of exhaustion). your back will thank you if it\'s well supported. ? watch your posture. listen to your mom, mom-and stand up straight, even when you\'re swaying from side to side. slouched shoulders result in an aching back. as your baby gets bigger, avoid resting that growing weight on one hip, which will throw your back off further, plus lead to hip pain. ? wear your baby. instead of always holding your baby, wear him or her in a sling or wrap. not only will it be soothing to baby (and you), but it\'ll be a relief to your achy back and arms. ? pull a switch. many moms play favor- ites with their arms, always carrying (or bottle-feeding) baby in the left arm or the right. instead, alternate arms so they each get a workout (and you don\'t get a lopsided ache). ? rub it. can\'t spare the time and change for the professional massage your muscles are aching for? ask your spouse to step in and rub. ? turn up the heat. a heating pad can spell relief from back pain and muscle aches. apply it often, especially during those marathon feeding sessions. ask your practitioner (or the baby\'s pediatrician) whether it\'s okay to use topical creams or heat patches if you\'re breastfeeding. you\'ll probably get the green light, but it\'s good to ask, just to be on the safe side. as your body adjusts to toting a baby all the time, you\'ll probably find that pain in your back (and arms, and hips, and neck) diminishing, and you may even find yourself sporting some new baby biceps. in the meantime, here\'s something else that might help ease your aches by easing your load: unload that diaper bag. lug around only what you absolutely need, which is plenty heavy anyway.","title" : "postpartum backache"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 225,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i was sure i\'d be over the moon once my baby was born. but i\'m feeling down instead. what\'s going on?\" how can something so happy make you feel so sad?

after all that buildup, all the planning and preparation and dreaming and drama and anticipation and exhilaration, your child has been born, and you feel not only run down (that\'s the sleep deprivation talking) but also a tiny bit let down. welcome to the postpartum club, when you suddenly realize why the word \"baby\" is so often followed by the word \"blues.\" not every new parent experiences the so-called baby blues (about 10 percent of new dads do), but you can pretty predictably expect a potent cocktail of emotions in both of you (fortunately, it\'s likely only one of you will experience down feelings at a time). be ready. and be strong. you\'ll need the patience of a saint, the endurance of a triathlete, and a sense of humor (big time) to work through this period of adjustment. adapt the tips for her baby blues (on these pages) to your needs during this rough patch. if those don\'t help, and baby blues progress to depression, talk to your doctor about getting the help you need so you can start enjoying life with your new baby. (which drop precipitously after childbirth) and a draining delivery followed by an exhausting homecoming, all compounded by the round-the-clock demands of newborn care, sleep deprivation, possible feelings of new mommy self-doubt, breastfeeding stumbling blocks (sore nipples, painful engorgement), unhappiness over your looks (the bags under your eyes, the pooch around your belly, the fact that there are more dimples on your thighs than on your baby\'s), and stress from inevitably shifting relationship dynamics. with such an overwhelming laundry list of challenges to confront (and don\'t even get you started on the laundry that\'s on that list), it\'s no wonder you\'re feeling down. the baby blues will likely fade over the next couple of weeks as you adjust to your new life and start getting a little more rest-or, more realistically, begin functioning more effectively on less rest. in the meantime, try the following tips to help lift yourself out of that postpartum slump: lower the bar. feeling overwhelmed and underprepared in your role as a newbie mom? it may help to remember that you won\'t be for long. after just a few weeks on the job, you\'re likely to feel much more comfortable in those mom shoes. in the meantime, lower your expectations for yourself-and for your baby. then lower them some more. make this your mommy (or daddy) mantra, even after you\'ve become a parenting pro: there\'s no such thing as a perfect parent. expecting too much means you\'ll be letting yourself down- and bringing your mood down, too. instead, just do the best you can (which at this point may not be as well as you\'d like, but that\'s okay). don\'t go it alone. nothing is more depressing than being left alone with a crying newborn, that mountain of spit-up-stained laundry, a leaning tower of dirty dishes, and the promise (make that guarantee) of another sleep-deprived night ahead. so if it\'s feasible, ask for more help-from your partner, your mother, your sister, your friends. dress yourself. yes, you\'re busy dressing (and diapering) your baby-but have you forgotten to dress yourself? it sounds trite, but it\'s surprisingly true. spending a little time making yourself look good will actually help you feel good-even if baby\'s the only one seeing you all day. so hit the shower and maybe even the blow-dryer before your spouse hits the commuter train in the morning, trade in the stained sweats for a clean pair, and consider applying a little makeup (and a lot of concealer). wear your baby. babywearing can boost your mood and baby\'s (babies who are worn more cry less, and that\'s a happy fact). see box, facing page. leave home. it\'s amazing what a change of scenery can do for your state of mind-especially when the scenery doesn\'t include the cluttered mess that was once your home. so try to get out of the house with baby at least once a day: take a walk, stroll the mall, grab a coffee with friends. anything that will keep you from hosting another (understandable) self-pity party. treat yourself. next time you have 30 minutes to yourself, grab it. take a nap, a long shower, a mini-mani, or a chance to catch up on social media or a guilty pleasure celebrity gossip site. occasionally, make yourself a priority. you deserve it. get moving. exercise boosts those feel-good endorphins, giving you an all-natural (and surprisingly lasting) high. so join a postpartum exercise class (look for one that includes babies in the fun), work out to a post-pregnancy exercise dvd or a youtube video, step out for some exercises that tone with the help of a stroller full of baby, or just simply step out for a walk. be a happy snacker. too often, new moms are too busy filling their babies\' tummies to worry about filling their own. a mistake, since low blood sugar sends not only energy levels plummeting but moods, too. to keep yourself on a more even keel, physically and emotionally, stash sustaining, healthy, easy-to-munch snacks within quick reach. tempted to reach for a chocolate bar instead? go ahead and reach-especially if chocolate really makes you happy-just remember sugar-induced blood sugar highs have a way of crashing quickly.

hands-free baby care, allowing you to soothe your baby, rock your baby, even eventually feed your baby without lifting a finger-leaving your hands and arms available for just about anything else you have to get done. but can babywearing (wearing your little one in a sling or carrier) also wear away the baby blues in new moms (and dads)? or even help ease postpartum depression? some say yes-and for several reasons: ? wearing your baby close to you (like skin-to-skin contact) increases your levels of oxytocin, one of the body\'s happiest hormones. also known as the \"bonding hormone,\" oxytocin not only helps cement your emotional connection to your baby, but relieves stress and eases postpartum aches- both of which can bring a new mama down. in fact, low levels of oxytocin have been linked to postpartum depression, as well as postpartum anxiety disorders. pumping up the oxytocin by wearing your baby may actually boost your mood. ? wearing your baby makes your baby happier. babies who are worn more cry less and sleep and feed better- and what could make a new parent happier (and more confident) than that? ? wearing your baby leaves your arms and legs free-free to eat a meal, catch up on work, get the laundry done, and yes, even do your hair (your hair!). all of which can make you feel better. ? wearing your baby lets you get out more. there\'s no easier way to take a walk, do the marketing, have lunch with a friend. plus, a baby who\'s worn isn\'t easily touched by prying (possibly germy) strangers-an added perk. of course, if babywearing isn\'t for you-you just don\'t feel comfortable doing it-don\'t feel obligated. remember, every mom is different- and what feels right for you is almost always what\'s best for you. keep in mind, too, that while babywearing may be very therapeutic for new moms battling the baby blues or even mild depression or anxiety, it may not be the answer for every mom, and it\'s likely not enough to treat more serious postpartum depression. and laugh. try laughing, too, at all the mishaps you\'re likely having-you know, the diaper blowout, the breasts that leaked in line at the market, the spit-up that spewed only after you realized you had left home without wipes. you know what they say: laughter is the best medicine. plus, a good sense of humor is a parent\'s best friend. still blue, no matter what you do? keep on reminding yourself that you\'ll outgrow the baby blues within a week or two-most moms do-and you\'ll be enjoying the best of times, most of the time, in no time. but also remember that there\'s a big-and very significant-difference between baby blues and postpartum depression. if the baby blues just don\'t fade, or appear later than expected, if feelings of sadness persist (lasting more than 2 weeks) or get worse, and/or if you start to feel very anxious, you may be suffering from postpartum depression. \"i don\'t have any sign of baby blues-but my partner seems really down. could he have baby blues?\" does your partner seem to be down while you\'re flying high? studies show that a new dad is far more likely to experience baby blues when the new mom in his life escapes them (and conversely, he\'s unlikely to be down when she is-perhaps nature\'s way of ensuring that both parents don\'t slump at the same time). hormonal changes (dads experience those, too, postpartum) may be a trigger when dad gets the blues, as may all the inevitable life changes that come with a new baby. either way, it\'s important that he not keep his feelings under wraps, something a new dad may feel compelled to do to avoid dumping on his spouse. encourage him to talk them out-and to see the box, page 495.","title" : "wearing away the baby blues"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 228,"author" : "heidi

as baby blues?\" though \"baby blues\" and \"postpar-tum depression\" are often used interchangeably to describe new mom moodiness, they\'re actually two very different conditions. the far more common baby blues appear and fade quickly. true postpartum depression (ppd) is much less prevalent (affecting about 15 percent of new moms) and much more enduring (lasting anywhere from a few weeks to a year or even more). it may have roots in pregnancy depression, it may begin at delivery, or (more often) it may not start until a month or two after baby\'s born. sometimes ppd comes far later-it doesn\'t begin until a new mom gets her first postpartum period or until she weans her nursing baby (possibly because of fluctuating hormones). more susceptible to ppd are women who\'ve had it before, have a history of depression or severe pms, spent a lot of time feeling down or depressed during pregnancy, had a complicated pregnancy or delivery, or have a premature or sick baby. women who have had a miscarriage or stillbirth are more susceptible to postpartum depression (and anxiety) with a subsequent healthy delivery, often because they can\'t shake the feeling that something will go wrong again. the symptoms of ppd are similar to those of baby blues, though much more pronounced. they include crying and irritability, sleep problems (not being able to sleep or wanting to sleep the day away), eating problems (having no appetite or wanting to do nothing but eat), persistent feelings of sadness, f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "postpartum depression"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

condition that requires prompt, professional treatment. the same goes for other postpartum mood disorders, including postpartum anxiety disorder, postpartum ocd, post-par-tum ptsd, and postpartum psychosis. if the mom in your life still seems truly overwhelmed, sad, angry, anxious, or hopeless several weeks after the baby comes home, isn\'t sleeping or is sleeping all the time, won\'t leave the house or let anyone come over to visit, isn\'t eating or isn\'t otherwise functioning normally-as normally as can be expected given her demanding new mom life- sit down with her and tell her you\'re worried about her wellbeing. focus on the behaviors you\'ve seen-crying constantly, raging for no apparent reason, refusing to leave the house or answer the phone, being uncharacteristically anxious, jittery, or stressed, not interacting well with the baby-and encourage her to share her feelings with you. reassure her that whatever she\'s going through is in no way her fault-it\'s not because she\'s weak or a bad mother. and remind her that you are and will be there to support her every step of the way. emotional support from a partner is an essential component in the recovery from ppd. but don\'t stop there. encourage her to talk to her practitioner about it and, as needed, to get a referral to a psychotherapist or psychologist. don\'t leave it up to her if she says no-make the calls yourself. she may not recognize the signs of depression. be sure you know the signs (see facing page), and understand that she may not experience all of the symptoms (postpartum depression and anxiety are not one-size-fits-all illnesses). make sure she gets the treatment she needs to feel better, and be as supportive as you can of the treatment plan that\'s proposed. if one treatment method doesn\'t work (and it won\'t necessarily, at least at first), encourage her to be open to others-and not to give up. ppd is treatable, but finding the right treatment sometimes takes time. and though much of your focus will understandably be on your partner as you try to help her get better, realize that-for now-she may not be up to much, or (in a severe case of ppd) any of the baby care. step in to provide the nurturing your newborn needs, and if you can\'t provide it all because of your work schedule, try to find a friend or family member (or baby nurse, if you can afford one) to fill in as needed. keep in mind that it\'s normal for you to feel frustrated or disappointed that your partner isn\'t over the moon happy in her new role with your new baby- so don\'t fault yourself for feeling that way. find ways to give yourself a break, too, and remember there are other dads who know exactly what you\'re going through. check out the support pages for dad on postpartum.net. be aware, too, that dads can also suffer from ppd. your own hormones are in flux postpartum, too, and it\'s natural for the combination of the new baby, the stress of the past 9 months, and the new sense of responsibility to take their toll. in fact, 1 in 4 dads experience paternal postnatal depression (ppnd), a dad\'s version of ppd. you may feel left out, or you may feel overwhelmed by everything that\'s expected of you. if you suspect you have ppnd, talk to your partner or a trusted friend or family member about it, and don\'t hesitate to seek professional treatment-for the health and wellbeing of both you and your baby. emptiness, hopelessness, and helplessness, an inability (or lack of desire) to take care of yourself or your newborn, social withdrawal, excessive worry, aversion to your newborn, feeling all alone, and memory loss. if you haven\'t already tried the tips for getting the baby blues to fade (see page 496), do try them now. some of them may be helpful in easing ppd, too. but if moderate symptoms continue for more than 2 weeks without any noticeable improvement, or if you\'re having more serious symptoms for more than a few days, chances are your ppd won\'t go away without professional attention. don\'t wait to see if it does (and don\'t delay at all if you\'re having symptoms that might result in harm to yourself or your baby). and don\'t be put off by reassurances that such feelings are normal postpartum-they\'re not. call your practitioner and be up front about how you\'re feeling. ask for a referral to a therapist who has a clinical background in the treatment of ppd, and make an appointment promptly. therapy, the first line of defense, can help you feel better fast, and if your therapist thinks medications will help, too, there are several antidepressants that are safe even if you\'re breastfeeding (though it can take time to figure out the right meds at the right dose). bright light therapy can also be effective in reducing symptoms of

they\'re ashamed to ask for help (they shouldn\'t be). ppd can keep a new mom from nurturing her little one, which could lead to slower development (babies of depressed moms are less vocal, less active, make fewer facial expressions, and are more anxious, passive, and withdrawn). luckily, there is more and more awareness about ppd and the need for new moms who are suffering from it to get the help and treatment they need. most hospitals send new moms home with educational materials about ppd so that they (and just as important, their partners and other family members) will be more likely to spot the symptoms early and seek treatment. practitioners are becoming better informed, too-learning how to look for risk factors during pregnancy that might predispose a woman to ppd, to screen routinely for the illness postpartum, and to treat it quickly, safely, and successfully. pediatricians-who have many more opportunities to interact with new moms than obs or midwives do- are often the first line of defense when it comes to spotting ppd. the aap recommends that pediatricians screen for ppd at 1-, 2-, and 4-month visits by asking new moms to complete a short checklist called the edinburgh postnatal depression scale-basically 10 questions designed to reveal whether a new mother is struggling with ppd. ppd is one of the most treatable forms of depression. so if it strikes you,

thyroid levels. the","title" : "getting help for ppd"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 231,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "nearly all new mothers feel run-down and tired. most have trouble losing weight. many feel blue at least some of the time, and just about all experience hair loss. it may not be a pretty picture, but for the majority of moms, it\'s a completely normal one in postpartum-and one that gradually begins to look better as the weeks pass. for the estimated 7 to 8 percent of women who suffer from postpartum thyroiditis (ppt), however, this picture may not improve with time. and, because the symptoms of ppt are so similar to those weathered by most new moms, the condition may go undiagnosed and untreated. ppt may start anywhere from 1 to 4 months after delivery with a brief episode of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone). this period of excess thyroid hormone circulating in the bloodstream may last 2 to 8 weeks. during this hyperthyroid period, a new mom may be tired, irritable, and nervous, feel very overheated, and experience increased sweating and insomnia-all of which are common in the immediate postpartum period anyway, making an easy diagnosis more elusive. that\'s okay, because treatment isn\'t usually needed for this phase. in about 25 percent of women with ppt, this hyperthyroid period will be followed by one of hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) that often lasts about 2 to 6 months. with hypothyroidism, fatigue continues, along with depression (longer lasting and often more severe than typical baby blues), muscle aches, excessive hair loss, dry skin, cold intolerance, poor memory, and an inability to lose weight. again, so close to typical new mom symptoms that they may be easy to write off as postpartum-as-usual. some new moms with ppt experience only hyperthyroidism, while others have only hypothyroidism, which begins 2 to 6 months after delivery. if your postpartum symptoms seem to be more pronounced and persistent than you would have expected, and especially if they are interfering with your ability to function and enjoy your baby, check with your practitioner. a blood test can easily determine whether ppt is the cause of your symptoms. be sure to mention any personal history of thyroid problems or a family history (especially on your mom\'s side of the family, since there is a very strong genetic link). most women recover from ppt within a year after delivery. in the meantime, treatment with supplementary thyroid hormone can help them feel much better much faster. about 25 percent of women who have the condition, however, remain hypothyroid, requiring lifetime treatment (which is as easy as taking a pill every day and having a yearly blood test). even in those who recover spontaneously, thyroiditis is likely to recur during or after subsequent pregnancies. for this reason, it makes sense for women who have had ppt to have a yearly thyroid screening and, if they are planning another pregnancy, to be screened in the preconception period and during pregnancy (because an untreated thyroid condition can interfere with conception and cause problems during pregnancy). same tips that are used to deal with pregnancy depression (see page 44) apply to ppd as well. whichever treatment (or combination of treatments) you and your therapist decide is right for you-and even if it takes time to figure out the best treatment in your case-the most important first step is the one you\'re taking: acknowledging that you\'re","title" : "thyroiditis got you down?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 232,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "new moms often have ups and downs, occasional moments of feeling overwhelmed and stressed, even anxious-and most do more than their share of unnecessary worrying. for the most part, that\'s the adjustment talking-and the sleep deprivation. and it\'s to be expected. but sometimes, it\'s not as easy as that-or as normal. postpartum mood disorders are distinctly different from typical new mom mood swings-and they come in many forms, sometimes accompanying ppd or appearing instead of it. all the following postpartum mood disorders need prompt diagnosis and treatment. if you notice any symptoms of these conditions, don\'t delay in getting the help you need: postpartum anxiety disorder. some new moms, instead of (or in addition to) feeling depressed postpartum, feel extremely anxious or fearful, sometimes experiencing panic attacks that include rapid heartbeat and breathing, hot or cold flashes, chest pain, nausea, insomnia, dizziness, and shaking. women with a history of anxiety or panic attacks (during pregnancy or before) are more likely to experience these symptoms postpartum. postpartum anxiety affects about 10 percent of new moms, and about half of those who have ppd will also experience postpartum anxiety. a mom with postpartum anxiety may feel a constant sense of dread-as if something is about to go terribly wrong. or she\'ll worry constantly about her baby\'s health and development, her ability to parent well, and how she\'s going to balance parenting and the rest of her responsibilities at work and home. these worries aren\'t the normal new mom worries (they\'re more extreme) and are typically not based on any real problem or threat. for instance, a mom suffering from postpartum anxiety may be fearful that her baby is alarmingly sick or in pain every time he or she cries. or that she might fall asleep while holding her baby and drop him or her. or have a pervasive, nagging fear that her baby has died or that she\'s left her baby in the hot car or that someone is going to break into the house and kidnap her sleeping baby. sometimes a new mom suffering from postpartum anxiety may feel restless and jittery all the time-even though she\'s exhausted. postpartum anxiety, like ppd, requires prompt treatment by a qualified therapist. such treatment may include therapy (talk or cognitive behavioral therapy), learning techniques such as meditation, relaxation exercises, and mindfulness training, and, if necessary, medication. postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder (ppocd). about 30 percent of women suffering from ppd also exhibit signs of postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder (ppocd), though ppocd can also occur by itself. symptoms of ppocd include obsessive-compulsive behaviors, such as waking up every 15 minutes to make sure the baby is still breathing, developing an obsessive order for doing ordinary depressed and seeking help. without the right treatment, ppd can prevent you from bonding with, caring for, and enjoying your baby. it can also have a devastating effect on your baby\'s emotional, social, and physical development (see box, facing page), on the other relationships in your life, and on your own health and wellbeing. tasks (like tapping on the light switch 3 times before turning it on) and worrying that straying from the order will cause her baby harm, furious housecleaning, or having obsessive thoughts about harming her newborn (such as throwing the baby out the window or dropping him or her down the stairs). women suffering from ppocd are horrified by their gruesome and violent thoughts, though they won\'t act on them (only those suffering from postpartum psychosis might; see below). still, they can be so afraid of losing control and following through with these impulses that they may end up neglecting their babies. like ppd, treatment for ppocd includes a combination of therapy and antidepressants. if you\'re having obsessive thoughts and/or behaviors, be sure to get help by telling your practitioner about your symptoms. postpartum psychosis. much more rare and much more serious than ppd is postpartum psychosis. its symptoms include loss of reality, hallucinations, and/or delusions. if you\'re experiencing suicidal, violent, or aggressive feelings, are hearing voices or seeing things, or have other signs of psychosis, call your doctor and go to the emergency room immediately. don\'t underplay what you\'re feeling, and don\'t be put off by

though childbirth produces more rapid weight loss than any fad diet (an average of 12 pounds overnight), most new moms don\'t find it rapid enough. particularly once they catch a glimpse of their still pregnant-looking postpartum profiles in the mirror. the fact is, no one comes out of the delivery room looking all that much slimmer than when they went in. part of the reason for that protruding postpartum belly is your still-enlarged uterus, which will be reduced to prepregnancy size and relocated to its previous pelvic position by the end of 6 weeks, shrinking your girth in the process. another reason for your belly bloat might be leftover fluids, which should be getting flushed out soon. and then there are those stretched-out abdominal muscles and skin, which will likely take some effort to tone up-plus a few extra fat stores that helped nurture your baby during pregnancy (and are still nurturing baby if you\'re breastfeeding). as hard as it might be to put it out of your mind, don\'t even think about the shape your body\'s in during the first 6 weeks, especially if you\'re breastfeed-ing. this is a recovery period, during which ample nutrition is important for your energy, mood, resistance to infection, and general wellbeing. sticking to a healthy postpartum diet should start you on the way to slow, steady weight loss for now. if, after 6 weeks, you aren\'t losing any weight, you can start cutting back sensibly on calories. if you\'re breastfeeding, don\'t go overboard. eating too few calories can reduce milk production, and burning fat too quickly can release toxins into the blood, which can end up in your breast milk. if you\'re not breastfeeding, you can aim to lose weight somewhat faster once you\'ve passed the 6-week mark, but stick to diets that are well balanced and provide enough calories to fuel the energy every new mom needs. some women find that the extra pounds melt off while they\'re breast-feeding, while others are bummed to find the scale doesn\'t budge. if the latter turns out to be the case with you, don\'t worry-you\'ll be able to shed any remaining weight once you\'ve weaned your baby. how quickly you return to your prepregnant weight will also depend on how many pounds you put on during pregnancy. if you didn\'t gain much more than 25 to 35 pounds, you\'ll likely be able to pack away those maternity jeans in a few months, without strenuous dieting. if you gained 35 or more pounds, you may find it takes more effort and more time-anywhere from 10 months to 2 years-to return to prepregnancy weight and your skinny jeans. either way, give yourself a break- and give yourself some time. remember, it took you 9 months to gain that pregnancy weight, and it may take at least that long to take it off.","title" : "losing weight postpartum"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 234,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"it\'s been a week since my c-section. what can i expect now?\" while you\'ve definitely come a long way since you were wheeled into recovery, like every new mom, you\'re still in recovery mode. and like every mom who\'s had a c-section, you\'re recovering not only from pregnancy and childbirth, but from surgery. you\'ll recover faster if you follow your doctor\'s instructions both for post-op and for all those things new moms aren\'t known for in general (getting enough rest and not overdoing it come to mind). in the meantime you can expect: progressive improvement in pain. most of the pain should dissipate by the end of the first 6 weeks (though some moms experience occasional pain and other twinges much longer, even months later). your scar will be sore and sensitive for the first few weeks, but it should improve steadily. occasional sensations of pulling or twitching and other brief pains around the incision site are a normal part of healing and eventually subside. itchiness around and on the scar (another normal-if extra annoying- part of the healing process) may follow. if it does, ask your practitioner to recommend an anti-itch ointment that you can apply. the numbness surrounding the scar will last longer, possibly several months. lumpiness in the scar tissue will probably diminish, and the scar may turn pink or purple before it finally fades. narcotics during the first 2 weeks after birth are considered okay in safe doses if you feel you need them, but acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil) should do the trick after the first week, so try to wean yourself off any pain meds as quickly as you\'re able, particularly if you\'re breastfeeding. if pain at the incision site gets worse, or if the area around the incision turns an angry red, or if a brown, gray, green, or yellow discharge oozes from the wound, call your doctor. the incision may have become infected.

expected happiness and serenity-a fleeting moment of sadness, agitation, dread, guilt, anger, or resentment? feelings that pass quickly but leave you unsettled, wondering what could be triggering such an unexpected response to breastfeeding? it\'s little known and discussed, but a small percentage of breastfeeding moms suffer from dysphoric milk ejection reflex (d-mer)-a rare condition in which the milk let-down reflex itself brings on a range of negative emotions. the emotions begin immediately before the milk lets down and last anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. experts say d-mer isn\'t psychological (it\'s not an aversion to breastfeed-ing, and it\'s not related to postpartum depression), rather it\'s a physiological hormonal response, related to the sudden decrease in the brain chemical dopamine (responsible for mood stabilizing and happy thoughts) immediately before milk let-down. so what can you do if you\'re experiencing d-mer? first, know that the condition will pass-gradually improving and eventually disappearing (likely by the time baby\'s 6 months old). second, remember that those negative emotions don\'t represent your true feelings- they\'re just a momentary hormonal response. moms with d-mer (unlike moms with ppd) feel fine throughout the rest of the day. understanding what is happening, and reminding yourself that it\'s very temporary, can help you cope with d-mer. it may also help to keep track of those surges of negative feelings to see whether there\'s a pattern of intensity to them (maybe they come on more strongly when you\'re dehydrated or extra tired) and whether there are proactive steps you can take to ease them. third, ask your practitioner if there are any therapies (such as breastfeeding-safe herbal remedies, acupuncture, or dietary changes) that might help. exercise can boost dopamine levels naturally, which means that taking a walk with baby before feeds may give you a lift during let-down. finally, reach out to your social media mom network to see if you can find other moms who have experienced the symptoms of d-mer. as always, knowing that you\'re not alone in what you\'re feeling can be

recommend waiting longer. if your practitioner still has you in a holding pattern, but you think you\'re ready to move forward, ask if there\'s a reason why you shouldn\'t, and if there isn\'t, whether you can get busy earlier. if it turns out there is a reason, hold off and wait for clearance. keep in mind that time will fly when you\'re caring for a newborn. in the meantime, assuming

during the postpartum period-and beyond-for a variety of reasons. first, as you already suspect, postpartum sex can be more pain than pleasure-especially if you delivered vaginally, but, surprisingly, even if you labored and then had a c-section. after all, your vagina has just been stretched to its earthly limits, and possibly torn or surgically cut and sutured to boot- leaving you too sore to sit, never mind contemplate sex. adding to the pain potential no matter which exit your baby took: low levels of estrogen cause the vaginal tissue to remain thin, and thin is not in as far as vaginas are concerned. and, your natural lubrications haven\'t turned on yet, making you feel uncomfortably dry where you\'d rather be moist-especially if you\'re breast-feeding (breastfeeding hormones can keep you dry longer). but your libido has other problems to contend with postpartum besides the physical ones: your understandable preoccupation with a very little and very needy person, who is given

in tip-top shape. avoid sick people like the plague. as best as you can, try to stay away from anyone who has a cold, flu, stomach virus, or anything else noticeably contagious. keep your distance from coughers on the bus, avoid hugging a friend who\'s complaining of a sore throat, and evade the handshake of a colleague with a runny nose (handshakes spread germs, not just greetings). also avoid crowded or cramped indoor spaces when you can. wash your hands. hands are the major spreader of infections, so wash them often and thoroughly with soap and warm water (about 20 seconds does the trick), particularly after exposure to someone you know is sick and after spending time in public places or riding on public transit. hand washing is especially important before eating. keep a hand sanitizer or hand sanitizing wipes in your glove compartment, in your desk drawer, and in your handbag or briefcase so you can wash up when there\'s no sink in sight. don\'t share the germs. at home,

and try to get them to cough and sneeze into their elbows instead of their hands (a good tip for adults, too). use disinfectant spray or wipes on phones, tablets, keyboards, remotes, and other surfaces they handle. if your own child or a child you care for or regularly spend time with develops a rash of any kind, avoid close contact and call your doctor as soon as you can unless you already know that you are immune to chicken pox, fifth disease, and measles. be pet smart. keep pets in good health, updating their immunizations as necessary. and be sure to wash your hands after handling pet food or bowls (they sometimes harbor bacteria). if you have a cat, take the precautions to avoid toxoplasmosis (page 72). look out for ticks and mosquitoes. avoid areas where lyme disease or the

for relief. antacids like tums and rolaids are considered safe to take during pregnancy, and some practitioners may okay gas relievers, but ask first. your practitioner may also okay certain

isn\'t widely known because its symptoms are mild and can go unnoticed-or may even be totally absent. fever is present in only 15 to 30 percent of cases. for the first few days, the rash gives the cheeks the appearance of having been slapped, then spreads in a lacy pattern to trunk, buttocks, and thighs, recurring on and off (usually in response to heat from the sun or a warm bath) for 1 to 3 weeks. it can be confused with the rash of other childhood illnesses or even a sun- or windburn. adults don\'t typically show the \"slapped cheek\" rash. concentrated exposure from caring for a child

means you would have to catch it first, something that\'s unlikely. first of all, your child probably won\'t catch it and bring it home if she was immunized with the varicella vaccine (it\'s recommended that all tots get their first dose of the varicella vaccine at age 1 year-hopefully yours did). second of all, it\'s very likely you had the infection as a child (85 to 95 percent of the u.s. adult population has had it) or had the vaccine, and are already immune. ask your parents or check your health records to find out whether you have had chicken pox or received the vaccine (which became available in 1995). if you can\'t find out for sure, ask your practitioner to run a test now to see if you are immune. though the chances of your becoming infected are slim if you aren\'t immune, an injection of varicella-zoster immune globulin (vzig) within 96 hours of a documented personal exposure (in other words, direct contact with someone who has been diagnosed with chicken pox) may be recommended. it isn\'t clear whether or not this will protect the baby if you do end up with chicken pox anyway, but it should minimize complications for you-a significant plus, since this mild childhood disease can be quite severe in adults. if you should be hit with a severe case, you may be given an antiviral drug to further reduce the risk of complications. if you become infected during the first half of your pregnancy, the chances are very low (around 2 percent) that your baby could develop a condition called congenital varicella syndrome, which can cause some birth defects. if you come down with chicken pox later in your pregnancy, there\'s almost zero danger to the baby. the exception is if you get chicken pox just before (within a week of) giving birth or just after delivery. in that extremely unlikely scenario, there\'s a small chance your newborn will arrive infected and would develop the characteristic rash within a week or so. to prevent neonatal infection, your baby would be given an infusion of chicken pox antibodies immediately after delivery (or as soon as it becomes apparent that you\'ve been infected postpartum). shingles, or herpes zoster, which is a reactivation of the chicken pox virus in someone who had the disease earlier (and happens only rarely in pregnant women), does not appear to be harmful to a fetus, probably because the mom- and so her baby-already has antibodies to the virus. if you are not immune and escape infection this time, ask your doctor about getting immunized after delivery, to protect any future pregnancies. immunization

by the 3rd month, the risk is significantly lower. after that, the risk is lower still. don\'t remember if you were ever vaccinated with the mmr, or if you ever had measles, mumps, or rubella? check your medical records (or with your parents, who would most likely know whether they chose to opt out of routine vaccines like the mmr). if you\'re definitely not immune (or if titers show your immunity is low), you won\'t receive the mmr (or a booster) during pregnancy. though there has never been a problem reported among babies of women who were inadvertently vaccinated before they knew they were pregnant, experts advise not taking the theoretical risk. but you can be vaccinated with the mmr (or if your titers are low for only one of the diseases, with just that individual vaccine) right after delivery. this will not only help protect your little one until he or she is fully immunized, but will protect your future pregnancies as well. happily, the infection is rarely passed on to a fetus or newborn. that\'s because the antibodies your body produces after exposure pass right away through the placenta, completely protecting the baby from the infection. so even if you did catch it, it\'s unlikely to affect your pregnancy. still, your practitioner may suggest you get a shot of immunoglobulins within 2 weeks of exposure, just to be on the extra-safe side (the shot itself is safe, too). if you are planning to travel to an area with high rates of infection, or if you have hepatitis b or c, ask your physician about immunization against hepatitis a, which can be given during pregnancy.","title" : "hepatitis a"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 245,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'m a carrier of hepatitis b and just found out that i\'m

occasionally hitch a ride into the suburbs and city, too, via greenery brought in from the country. the best way to protect yourself is by taking preventive measures. if you are out in woodsy or grassy areas, or if you are handling greenery grown in such areas, wear long pants, tucked into boots or socks, and long sleeves, and use an insect repellent effective for deer ticks (such as one

entirely eliminates the possibility of infection). there is no need to save the tick for testing. if you find a tick and notice the characteristic blotchy, bull\'s eye rash at the bite site, see your

often than it does women who are not pregnant, and occurs most often in the third trimester or early postpartum. its onset is sudden, and most people with the condition wake up without warning to find their face drooping. the cause of this temporary facial paralysis is unknown, though experts suspect that certain viral or bacterial infections may cause swelling and inflammation of the facial nerve, triggering the condition. other symptoms sometimes accompanying the paralysis include pain behind the ear or in the back of the head, dizziness, drooling (because of the weak muscles), dry mouth,

important to stay realistic but also to stay positive, as well as hold off on any action until the pregnancy has proved to be unviable. supplements (oral or spray form) or even epsom salt baths may help ease symptoms, so ask your practitioner about these options, too. but if you\'re vomiting continually and/or losing significant amounts of weight, your practitioner will assess your need for bed rest, iv fluids, and/or hospitalization, as well as some sort of antiemetic (antinausea) drug (such as phenergan, reglan, or scopolamine), if diclegis alone hasn\'t worked. once you\'re able to keep food down again, it may help to tweak your diet to eliminate fatty and spicy foods, which are more likely to cause nausea, as well as to avoid any smells or tastes that tend to set you off. in addition, try to graze on many small high-carb and high-protein meals throughout the day, and be sure your fluid intake is adequate. keeping an eye on your urinary output is the best way to assess

only during pregnancy-occurs when the body becomes more resistant to insulin (the hormone that lets the body turn blood sugar into energy) and is less able to regulate the increased blood sugar of pregnancy effectively. since gd usually begins between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy, a glucose screening test is routine at around 28 weeks. if you came into pregnancy obese, however, gd may show up earlier (or you may have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes), which is why your practitioner may recommend screening earlier and more often. gd almost always goes away after delivery, but if you\'ve had it, you\'ll be checked postpartum to make sure it\'s gone. diabetes, both the kind that begins in pregnancy and the kind that started before conception, is not harmful to either a mom or her baby if it is well controlled. but if excessive sugar is allowed to circulate in a mother\'s blood and then enter the fetal circulation through the placenta, the potential problems for both mother and baby are serious. women who have uncontrolled gd are more likely to have a too-large baby, which can complicate delivery. they are also at risk for developing preeclampsia (see page 550) and stillbirth. uncontrolled diabetes could also lead to potential problems for the baby after birth, such as jaundice, breathing difficulties, and low blood sugar levels. later in life, he or she may be at an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. research also suggests that early uncontrolled gd (before 26 weeks) in a mom is associated with a greater chance of autism in her child. but it\'s

affect your baby. most studies show no health or developmental differences between infants of moms who experience hg and those who don\'t. to remember: those potential negative effects don\'t apply to moms who get the help they need to keep their blood sugar under control. how common is it? gd is fairly common, affecting around 7 to 9 percent of expectant moms. because it\'s more common among obese women, rates of gd are rising along with rising obesity rates in the u.s. older moms-to-be are more likely to develop gd, as are women with a family history of diabetes or gd. native americans, hispanic americans, and african americans are also at somewhat greater risk for gd. what are the signs and symptoms? most women with gd have no symptoms, though a few may experience: ? unusual thirst ? frequent urination in large amounts ? fatigue (which may be difficult to dif- ferentiate from pregnancy fatigue) ? sugar in the urine (detected at a rou- tine practitioner visit) what can you and your practitioner do? around your 28th week (earlier if you\'re overweight or obese or have other risk factors), you\'ll be given a glucose screening test (see page 294) and, if necessary, a more elaborate 3-hour glucose tolerance test. if these tests show you have gd, your practitioner will likely put you on a special diet (similar to the pregnancy diet), suggest you exercise regularly, and recommend you keep your weight gain within recommended limits to keep your gd under control. you may also need to check your blood glucose levels at home. if diet and exercise alone aren\'t enough to control your blood sugar level (they usually are), you may need supplementary insulin. the insulin can be given in shots, or metformin (or less often, glyburide) might be used as an alternative treatment for gd. fortunately, virtually all of the potential risks associated with gd can be eliminated through the careful control of blood sugar levels achieved by good self-care and medical care. can it be prevented? many of the same steps that can be taken to control gd can also help prevent it in the first place. conceiving at an ideal weight lowers risk, as can gaining the right amount of weight during pregnancy. so, too, can good dietary habits (eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, beans, and whole grains, limiting sugar, refined grains, and white potatoes, and making sure you\'re getting enough folic acid) and regular exercise (research shows that obese women who exercise cut their risk of developing gd by half). having gd during pregnancy does put you at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. but keeping your diet healthy, staying at or getting to a normal weight, and, even more important, continuing to exercise after baby is born (and beyond) significantly cuts that risk. so does breast-feeding your baby. experts say that breastfeeding improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, cutting the risk of developing diabetes down the road by half-and the longer you breastfeed, the lower your risk becomes.","title" : "know . . ."}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 268,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "i f your gd

sudden onset of high blood pressure, often (but not always) protein in the urine, and possibly other signs and symptoms. there may be excessive swelling (especially of the hands and face) with preeclampsia, but a diagnosis of the condition won\'t be made on the basis of swelling alone (swelling in pregnancy is usually completely normal). pregnancy-induced hypertension involves only an increase in blood pressure, and is not the same as preeclampsia. while it\'s unclear exactly what causes preeclampsia (see box, facing page), experts believe that it occurs when blood vessels in the placenta don\'t develop properly-they\'re narrower than normal-limiting the amount of blood that flows through them. these changes in blood flow to the placenta lead to high blood pressure and excessive swelling in the mom. and because the placenta doesn\'t function properly, it isn\'t as able to eliminate waste products fast enough, so those waste products build up in the blood, causing certain proteins that should stay in the bloodstream to leak into the urine. all this damage to the walls of these blood vessels can also result in changes in blood clotting, which in turn can lead to a host of other problems. if preeclampsia goes untreated, it could progress to eclampsia, a much more serious condition involving seizures (see page 563). unmanaged preeclampsia can also cause a number of other pregnancy complications, such as premature delivery or intrauterine growth restriction. how common is it? about 8 to 10 percent of pregnant women are diagnosed with preeclampsia, with the risk higher for women carrying multiple fetuses, women over 40, obese women, and women with high blood pressure, diabetes, or gestational diabetes. preeclampsia is more common in first pregnancies, and if you\'re diagnosed with preeclampsia in one of your pregnancies, you have a 1 in 3 chance of developing the condition in future pregnancies. that risk is higher if you\'re diagnosed with preeclampsia in your first pregnancy or if you develop preeclampsia early in any pregnancy. what are the signs and symptoms? symptoms of preeclampsia can include any or all of the following: ? a rise in blood pressure (to 140/90 or more in a woman who has never had high blood pressure before) ? protein in the urine ? severe headaches that aren\'t relieved by acetaminophen (tylenol) ? pain in the upper abdomen ? blurred or double vision ? rapid heartbeat ? scant and/or dark urine ? abnormal kidney function ? exaggerated reflex reactions ? severe swelling of hands and face ? severe swelling of the ankles that doesn\'t go away ? sudden excessive weight gain unre- lated to eating what can you and your practitioner do? regular prenatal care is the best way to catch preeclampsia in its early stages (your practitioner might be tipped off by a rise in your blood pressure, or any of the symptoms listed above). being alert to any such symptoms (and alerting your practitioner if you notice them) also helps, particularly if you had a history of hypertension before pregnancy, developed it during this pregnancy, or if you have diabetes or gestational diabetes. in 75 percent of cases, preeclampsia is mild. however, even a mild case can progress to severe preeclampsia or eclampsia very quickly if it\'s not diagnosed and treated promptly. in severe preeclampsia, blood pressure is consistently much higher and can lead to organ damage and other more serious complications if not properly managed. if you have a mild case, your doctor will probably recommend regular blood and urine tests (assessing platelet counts, liver enzymes, kidney function, urinary protein levels) to check if the condition is progressing, a daily kick count in the third trimester (recommended anyway; see page 315), blood pressure monitoring, changes to your diet (including eating more protein, fruits, veggies, low-fat dairy, and healthy fats, and less salt, as well as drinking enough water). some form of bed rest may also be prescribed, as well as an early delivery (as close to 37 weeks as possible).","title" : "preeclampsia"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 270,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "no one knows for sure what causes preeclampsia, though there are a number of theories: ? a genetic link. researchers hypoth- esize that the genetic makeup of the fetus could be one of the factors that predisposes a pregnancy to preeclampsia. so, if your mother or your partner\'s mother had preeclampsia during their pregnancies with either of you, you are somewhat more likely to have preeclampsia during your pregnancies. but the baby\'s genes are not the only ones in play. something in the mom-to-be\'s genetic makeup can also predispose her to preeclampsia, say experts. ? a blood vessel defect. it has been suggested that this defect causes the blood vessels in some women to constrict during pregnancy instead of widen (as usually happens). as a result of this vessel defect, researchers theorize, there is a drop in the blood supply to organs like the kidney and liver, leading to preeclampsia. the fact that women who experience preeclampsia during pregnancy are at an increased risk later in life of having some sort of cardiovascular condition also seems to indicate that the condition may be the result of a predisposition to high blood pressure. ? gum disease. pregnant women with severe gum disease are more than twice as likely to have preeclampsia than women with healthy gums. experts theorize that the infection causing the periodontal disease may travel to the placenta or produce chemicals that can cause preeclampsia. still, it is not known if periodontal disease causes preeclampsia or if it is just associated with it. ? an immune response to a foreign intruder: the baby. this theory suggests that the woman\'s body becomes \"allergic\" to the baby and placenta. this \"allergy\" causes a reaction in the mother\'s body that can damage her blood and blood vessels. the more similar the father\'s and mother\'s genetic markers are to each other, the more likely this immune response will occur. in a more severe case, you\'ll most likely be treated in the hospital with careful fetal monitoring (including non-stress tests and ultrasounds to check for fetal wellbeing and growth), medication to lower your blood pressure, magnesium sulfate (an electrolyte with antiseizure properties that may help prevent progression to eclampsia), and early delivery-often once you\'ve reached 34 weeks of pregnancy if your condition is stable. if it becomes unstable, the doctor may give you corticosteroids to speed your baby\'s lung maturity and deliver him or her right away, regardless of gestational age. keep in mind that while preeclampsia can be kept in check, the only way to absolutely cure the condition is by delivering your baby. the good news is that 97 percent of women with preeclampsia recover completely, with a speedy return to normal blood pressure, after delivery. that said, women with a history of preeclampsia have a higher risk of stroke, blood clots, and heart attack later in life, so be sure you continue to practice healthy habits- eating well, exercising, not smoking, and so on-and get good medical care and follow-up after your baby is born. eclampsia, aspirin or other anticlotting drugs during pregnancy may reduce the risk. this has led to the recommendation that women who have a higher risk of preeclampsia, but don\'t have signs or symptoms, be prescribed a low-dose aspirin daily (81 milligrams per day) after the 12th week of pregnancy. coming into pregnancy at a healthy weight may lower the risk of preeclampsia. some research has also suggested that good nutrition-including adequate intakes of vitamins and minerals (especially magnesium)-may reduce risk, as may regular exercise and proper dental care. one unexpected (and yummy) way to help prevent preeclampsia: regularly eating dark chocolate during the second half of pregnancy.","title" : "the reasons behind preeclampsia"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 271,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "what is it? like

baby\'s weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age based on ultrasound measurements. iugr can occur if the health of the placenta or its blood supply is impaired or if the mother\'s nutrition, health, or lifestyle prevents the healthy growth of her fetus. babies who have iugr often have a low weight at birth-called small for gestational age (or sga). but not all babies who are sga had iugr. some are healthy babies who are just born smaller than average because they\'re genetically destined to be. there are two types of iugr: symmetrical iugr, in which all parts of the

fact, there are rarely any obvious outward signs that the baby isn\'t growing in utero as he or she should be. instead, iugr is usually detected during a routine prenatal exam when the practitioner measures the fundal height-the distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus- and finds that it\'s measuring too small for the baby\'s gestational age, or through an ultrasound, which can detect a baby whose growth is slower than expected for his or her gestational age. what can you and your practitioner do? one of the best predictors of a baby\'s good health is birthweight, so having iugr can lead to some health problems in a newborn, including having difficulty maintaining a normal body temperature or fighting infection. that\'s why it\'s so important to diagnose and begin treating the problem as early at birth. a variety of approaches may be tried, depending on the suspected cause, including bed rest, iv feedings if necessary, and medications to improve placental blood flow or to correct a diagnosed problem that may be contributing to the iugr. if the uterine environment is poor and can\'t be improved, and the fetal lungs are mature, prompt delivery-which allows baby to start living under healthier conditions-is usually the best way to go. can it be prevented? optimum nutri- tion, good prenatal care, and the right weight gain for mom can all greatly improve the chances that a baby will grow, develop, and thrive as he or she should-as can eliminating lifestyle factors that can contribute to iugr (such as mom\'s smoking, drinking, or using recreational drugs), treating an eating disorder, minimizing physical and excessive psychological stress (such as from depression), and controlling chronic hypertension. happily, even when prevention and treatment are unsuccessful (or impossible) and a baby is born smaller than normal, the chances that he or she will do well are increasingly good, thanks to the many advances in neonatal (newborn) care.","title"

premature labor, which is more common with placenta previa). if you\'re experiencing bleeding related to a diagnosed previa, your practitioner will likely put you on pelvic rest (no sex), advise you to take it easy and avoid strenuous activities or exercise, and monitor you closely. if preterm labor seems imminent, you may receive steroid shots to mature your baby\'s lungs more rapidly. even if

no longer getting oxygen or nourishment. how common is it? it occurs in less than 1 percent of pregnancies, almost always in the second half of the pregnancy and most often in the third trimester. placental abruption can happen to anyone, but it occurs more commonly in women who have had a previous abruption or have a predisposition to clotting, as well as in those who are carrying multiples,

probably be put on in-hospital bed rest and given antibiotics to ward off infection, as well as steroids to mature your baby\'s lungs as quickly as possible for a safer early delivery. rarely, the break in the membranes heals and the leakage of amniotic fluid stops on its own. if that happens, you\'ll be allowed to go home and resume your normal routine while remaining alert to signs of further leakage. how common is it? preterm labor and preterm birth are fairly common. about 12 percent of babies are born preterm in the u.s. while no one knows for sure what causes premature labor, experts point to a number of factors that increase risk (see page 32 for a list of risk factors). keep in mind that having one or more of these risk factors doesn\'t mean you\'ll necessarily go into preterm labor-and having no risk factors doesn\'t mean that you won\'t. in fact, at least half of the women who go into preterm labor have no known risk factor. what are the signs and symptoms? signs of

preterm labor is to examine cervical or vaginal secretions for a substance known as fetal fibronectin (ffn). studies show that some women who test positive for ffn stand a good chance of going into preterm labor within 1 to 2 weeks after the test. the test, however, is better at predicting which women are not at risk for going into preterm labor (by detecting no ffn) than predicting which women are at risk. when ffn is detected, steps should be taken to reduce the chances of preterm labor. the test is now widely available, but is usually reserved for high-risk women only. if you aren\'t considered high risk for preterm birth, you don\'t need to be tested. another screening test is one for cervical length. via ultrasound before 30 weeks, the length of your cervix is measured to see if there are any signs that the cervix is shortening or opening. a short cervix puts you at an increased risk of preterm labor, especially if it began shortening early in pregnancy. though still

spd) is pain in the pelvic area and joints of the pelvis. it often happens because the ligaments that normally keep your pelvic bone aligned become overrelaxed and stretchy sooner than they should (as delivery nears, things are supposed to start loosening up significantly). this, in turn, can make the pelvic joints unstable, causing mild to severe pain. the pain may also result when a pelvic joint becomes stiff and stops moving normally, causing irritation in the other joints. how common is it? the incidence of diagnosed pgp is about 1 in 300 pregnancies. however, some experts believe that up to 25 percent of all pregnant women experience pgp-but most of those cases aren\'t diagnosed. what are the signs and symptoms? the most common symptom is a wrenching pain (as though your pelvis is coming apart) and difficulty walking. typically, the pain is focused on the pubic area, but in some women it radiates to the upper thighs and perineum. the pain can worsen when you\'re walking and doing any weight-bearing activity, particularly one that involves lifting one leg, such as when you\'re climbing up stairs, getting dressed, getting in and out of a car, even turning over in bed. in very rare cases, the joint may gape apart, which can cause more serious pain in your pelvis, groin, hips, and buttocks. what can you and your practitioner do? avoid aggravating the condition by limiting weight-bearing positions and minimizing as best you can any activity that involves lifting or separating your legs-even walking, if it\'s very uncomfortable (some practitioners will even recommend modified bed rest so the pain doesn\'t worsen). try stabilizing those floppy ligaments by wearing a pelvic support belt or band that corsets the bones back into place. kegels and pelvic tilts can help to strengthen the muscles of the pelvis. physical therapy may be especially helpful, so ask your practitioner for a referral. you can also ask about acupuncture and chiropractic therapies, as well as safe pain relievers. very rarely, pgp can make a vaginal delivery impossible and your practitioner may opt for a c-section instead. even more rarely, pgp can worsen after delivery, requiring surgery. but for most moms, once baby is born and production of ligament-relaxing hormones stop, ligaments return to normal.","title" : "pelvic girdle pain (pgp) or symphysis pubis

fetus, often at the neck (when it is known as a nuchal cord). some knots form during delivery, while others form during pregnancy when the baby moves around. as long as the knot remains loose, it\'s not likely to cause any problems at all. but if the knot becomes tight, it could interfere with the circulation of blood from the placenta to the baby and cause oxygen deprivation. such an event happens only rarely, but when it does, it is most likely to occur during baby\'s descent through the birth canal. how common is it? true umbilical cord knots occur in about 1 in every 100 pregnancies, but only in 1 in 2,000 deliveries will a knot be tight enough to present problems for the baby. the more common nuchal cords occur in as many as a quarter of all pregnancies but are usually harmless, very rarely posing any risk to the baby. babies with long cords and those who are large-for-gestational age are at greater risk for developing true knots. researchers speculate that nutritional deficiencies that affect the structure and protective barrier of the cord, or other risk factors, such as carrying multiples, having hydramnios, or smoking or drug use may make a woman more prone to having a pregnancy with a serious cord knot. what are the signs and symptoms? the most common sign of a cord knot is decreased fetal activity after week 37. if the knot occurs during labor (which is when knots are most often detected), a fetal monitor will detect an abnormal heart rate. what can you and your practitioner do? you can keep a general eye on how your baby is doing, especially later in pregnancy, by doing regular kick counts and calling your practitioner if you notice any pronounced decrease in fetal activity. if a loose knot tightens during delivery, your practitioner will be able to detect the drop in your baby\'s heart rate, and will make the appropriate decisions to ensure your baby\'s safe entry into the world. immediate delivery, usually via c-section, is often the

signs or symptoms with this condition-it\'s typically detected during a routine anatomy scan ultrasound. what can you and your practitioner do? if you\'ve been found to have a 2-vessel cord, your pregnancy will be monitored more closely, since the condition comes with a small increased risk of poor fetal growth and occasionally is linked to a malformation. in the absence of any other

"what is it? deep venous thrombosis, or dvt, is the development of a blood clot in a deep vein. these clots show up most commonly in the lower extremities, particularly the thigh. women are more susceptible to clots during pregnancy and delivery, and particularly in the postpartum period. this happens because nature, wisely worried about too much bleeding at childbirth, tends to increase the blood\'s clotting ability-occasionally too much. another factor that can contribute is the enlarged uterus, which makes it difficult for blood in the lower body to return to the heart. if untreated, a dvt can result in the clot moving to the lungs and becoming life threatening. how common is it? dvt occurs in 1 in every 500 to 2,000 pregnancies, including the postpartum period. dvt is more common if you are older, overweight, sedentary, a smoker, have a family or personal history of clots, or have hypertension, diabetes, or a variety of other conditions, including vascular diseases. prolonged bed rest with little activity can also put you at higher risk of dvt, as can long plane rides. what are the signs and symptoms? the most common symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis include: ? a heavy or painful feeling in the leg ? tenderness in the calf or thigh ? slight to severe swelling ? distension of the superficial veins ? calf pain on flexing the foot (turning the toes up toward the chin) if the blood clot has moved to the lungs (a pulmonary embolus), there may be: ? chest pain ? shortness of breath ? coughing with frothy, bloodstained sputum ? rapid heartbeat and breathing rate ? blueness of lips and fingertips ? fever what can you and your practitioner do? if you\'ve been diagnosed with dvt or any kind of blood clot in previous pregnancies, let your practitioner know. in addition, if you notice swelling and pain in just one leg at any time during your pregnancy, call your practitioner right away. don\'t massage the swelling. ultrasound may be used to diagnose a blood clot in the leg, and either a special scan (ventilation-perfusion) or ct study can diagnosis a clot in the lung. if it turns out that you do have a clot, you might be treated with heparin to thin your blood and prevent further clotting (though the heparin may need to be discontinued as you near term, to prevent you from bleeding excessively during delivery). your clotting ability will be monitored along the way. can it be prevented? you can prevent clots by keeping your blood flowing- getting enough exercise and avoiding long periods of sitting will help you do this. if you have to fly, get up and move around every hour or two and do ankle roll exercises while you sit. take stretching breaks frequently during long car rides, too. staying well hydrated can also help prevent a blood clot. if you\'re at high risk, you can also wear support hose to prevent clots from developing in your legs. if you\'ve been put on bed rest, take steps to reduce your risk (see page 577 for suggestions).","title" : "deep venous thrombosis"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 294,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "what is it? placenta accreta is an abnormally firm attachment

dealing with cancer when you found you were pregnant, or received a cancer diagnosis after discovering you were pregnant, there will be plenty of information to gather and choices to make in conjunction with both your prenatal team and your oncology team. treatment for cancer during pregnancy is a delicate balancing act between providing the best care for mom and limiting possible risk to her baby. the type of treatment you\'ll get will depend on many factors: how far along in pregnancy you are, the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer, and, of course, your wishes. the decisions you may face weighing your own wellbeing against your baby\'s may be emotionally wrenching, and you\'ll need plenty of support in making them. while surgery may be performed if it\'s needed, doctors usually delay any other treatment (such as chemotherapy) until the second or third trimesters, when it\'s safer. any treatment that might be harmful to the baby (for instance, radiation) will probably be postponed until after delivery. when cancer is diagnosed later in pregnancy, doctors may wait until after the baby is born to begin treatment, or they may consider inducing labor early. the reassuring news is that women diagnosed during pregnancy respond just as well to cancer treatment as women who are not pregnant, all other factors being equal. for more help, contact the national

hemorrhaging during delivery of the placenta. how common is it? only 1 out of 2,500 pregnancies will have an attachment abnormality. placenta accreta is by far the most common of these, accounting for 75 percent of cases. in placenta accreta, the placenta digs deeply into the uterine wall, but does not pierce the uterine muscles. your risk of placenta accreta increases if you have placenta previa and have had one or more cesarean deliveries in the past. in placenta increta, which accounts for 15 percent of cases, the placenta pierces the uterine muscles. in placenta percreta, which accounts for the final 10 percent, the placenta not only burrows into the uterine wall and its muscles, but also pierces the outer part of the wall and may even attach itself to other nearby organs. what are the signs and symptoms? there are usually no symptoms. the condition is usually diagnosed via color doppler ultrasound or may be noticed only during delivery when the placenta doesn\'t detach (as it normally would) from the uterine wall after the baby is born. what can you and your practitioner do? unfortunately, there is little you can do. in most cases, the placenta must be removed surgically

diabetes, placental abruption, too little or too much amniotic fluid, umbilical cord compression, prolapse, or entanglement, or intrauterine growth restriction. it can also occur when the mother has been in a position for an extended period of time (such as flat on her back) that puts pressure on major blood vessels, depriving the baby of oxygen. sustained oxygen deprivation and/or decreased heart rate can be serious for the baby and must be corrected as quickly as possible-usually with immediate delivery (most often by c-section, unless a vaginal birth is imminent). how common is it? the exact incidence of fetal distress is uncertain (especially because some cases are only temporary), but estimates range from 1 in every 25 births to 1 in every 100 births. what are the signs and symptoms? babies who are doing well in utero have strong, stable heartbeats and respond to stimuli with appropriate movements. babies in distress experience a decrease in heart rate, a change in their pattern of movement (or even no movement at all), and/or pass their first stool, called meconium, while still in the uterus. the only way you might suspect your baby is in distress is because of a noticeable slowdown of movement (after 28 weeks) or if your water broke and it was stained with meconium. the only way to know for sure is with a fetal monitor, nonstress test, or a biophysical profile ultrasound. what can you and your practitioner do? if you think your baby might be in distress because you\'ve noticed a change in fetal activity (it seems to have slowed down significantly, stopped, or otherwise has you concerned), call your practitioner immediately. call your practitioner, too, if your water breaks and you notice it\'s meconium stained (see page 398). once you are in your practitioner\'s office or in the hospital (or in labor), you\'ll be put on a fetal monitor to see whether your baby is indeed showing signs of distress. you may be given oxygen and iv fluids to help better oxygenate your blood and return your baby\'s heart rate to normal. if the reason your baby\'s in distress is that you\'ve been on your back for a prolonged period of time, turning onto your left side to take pressure off your major blood vessels may also do the trick. if these techniques don\'t work, the best treatment is a quick delivery. the same steps will be taken if you didn\'t

tiny bumps on your areolas, but once they start growing in size and number (as they typically do early in pregnancy), they\'ll be hard to miss. these bumps (called montgomery\'s tubercles) are actually glands that produce oils to lubricate your nipples and areolas-lubrication that\'ll certainly be welcome protection when baby starts suckling. another sign your body is planning ahead-way

be sure to fish selectively, sticking to those varieties that are lower in mercury-a chemical that in large, accumulated doses can possibly be harmful to a fetus\'s developing nervous system. luckily, many of the most commonly consumed fish are low in mercury: choose from salmon (wild caught is best), sole, flounder, haddock, trout, halibut, ocean perch, pollack, cod, light canned tuna, catfish, and other smaller ocean fish (anchovies, sardines, and herring are not only safe, but also loaded with omega-3s). it\'s smart to avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (especially from the gulf of mexico), since these types of fish contain high levels of mercury. don\'t worry if you\'ve already enjoyed a serving or two-any risks would apply to regular consumption- just skip these fish from now on. also limit your consumption of freshwater fish recreationally caught to an average of 6 ounces (cooked weight) per week-commercially-caught fish usually has lower levels of contaminants, so you can safely eat more. steer clear of fish from waters that are contaminated (with sewage or industrial runoff, for example) and tropical fish, such as grouper, amberjack, and mahimahi (which sometimes contain toxins). what about tuna, america\'s favorite fish in a can? the epa, the fda, and acog all agree that canned light tuna is safe to eat because it\'s not high in mercury. solid or chunk white tuna (usually albacore) contains 3 times the mercury of light varieties, and experts recommend limiting white tuna to no more than 6 ounces per week (the same limit

sugar-free yogurt. are sugar substitutes safe during pregnancy?\" they sound like a sweet deal, but the truth is that sugar substitutes are a somewhat mixed bag for expectant moms. though most are probably safe, some research is still inconclusive. here\'s the lowdown on the low-cal and no-cal sugar substitutes and their place in pregnancy: sucralose (splenda). it\'s sugar, sort of. at least it starts out life that way, before being chemically processed into a form that your body won\'t be able to absorb, making it essentially calorie free. sucralose, which has less of that aftertaste that gives sweeteners a bad name, appears to be safe during pregnancy and has been approved by the fda for pregnant women to consume-so sweeten your day (and your coffee, tea, yogurt, and smoothies) with it if you want, or with foods and drinks pre-sweetened with it. it\'s also stable for cooking and baking (unlike aspartame), making that sugar-free chocolate cake less pipe dream, more possibility. just make moderation your motto. aspartame (equal, nutrasweet). many experts believe it\'s harmless, and others think it\'s an unsafe artificial sweetener, whether you\'re pregnant or not. while the fda has approved aspartame for pregnant women, they do recommend that moms-to-be limit consumption. a packet or two of the blue stuff now and then, a can of diet coke every once in a while-no problem. just avoid consuming aspartame during pregnancy in large amounts, and steer clear of it altogether if you have pku. some diet sodas are sweetened with sucralose instead of aspartame, so they might be a better choice for expectant moms. saccharin (sweet\'n low). the fda has deemed saccharin safe, but some studies suggest that saccharin gets to your baby through the placenta, and when it does, it\'s slow to leave. for that reason, you might want to stay away from the pink packets-or pick them up only occasionally (say, when there\'s no yellow in sight). acesulfame-k (sunett). this sweet- ener, 200 times sweeter than sugar, is approved for use in baked goods, gelatin desserts, chewing gum, and soft drinks. the fda says it\'s okay to use in moderation during pregnancy, but since few studies have been done to prove its safety, ask your practitioner what he or she thinks before gobbling the stuff up. sorbitol. sorbitol is actually a nutritive sweetener, which is fine during pregnancy. but while it can\'t hurt your baby, it can have unpleasant effects on your tummy: in large doses, it can cause bloating, gas pains, and diarrhea- a digestive trio no pregnant woman needs. sorbitol is safe in moderate amounts, but keep in mind that it has more calories than other substitutes and less sweetness than regular sugar (so its calories can add up). mannitol. less sweet than sugar, mannitol is poorly absorbed by the body and thus provides fewer calories than sugar (but more than other sugar substitutes). like sorbitol, it is safe in modest amounts, but large quantities can cause gastrointestinal unrest (and pregnancy already comes with plenty of that). xylitol. a sugar alcohol derived from plants (it\'s naturally occurring in many","title" : "sugar substitutes"}},"add" :

a stimulated immune system), but none of these have actually been substantiated by science yet. if you crave kombucha, check with your practitioner before you chug, since it\'s unclear whether it\'s

safe during pregnancy in moderate amounts, it has 40 percent fewer calories than sugar and has been shown to prevent tooth decay-a good reason to grab a stick of xylitol-sweetened gum after meals and snacks when you can\'t brush. stevia (sweetleaf, truvia). derived from a south american shrub, stevia appears to be safe during pregnancy, but since it\'s relatively new to the sweetening scene, check with your practitioner before you dip deeply. agave. because it\'s low in glucose, agave doesn\'t spike your blood sugar like regular sugar does. but it contains more fructose than any other common sweetener, including high-fructose corn syrup, and experts believe that fructose is converted into fat more rapidly than glucose-which means using agave as a sugar substitute won\'t help in the weight department (or in blood sugar regulation). agave syrup is also highly processed. it\'s probably safe for use during pregnancy, but use it in moderation. lactose. this milk sugar is one-sixth as sweet as table sugar and adds light sweetening to foods. for those who are lactose intolerant, it can cause uncomfortable symptoms-otherwise it\'s safe. whey low. fructose (the sugar in fruit), sucrose (regular sugar), and lactose (milk sugar) are blended to create this low-glycemic sweetener that the makers say doesn\'t get completely absorbed into the body, giving you only one-quarter of the calories of sugar. it\'s probably safe for use during pregnancy, but run it by your practitioner. honey. everyone\'s all abuzz about honey because of its high levels of antioxidants (darker varieties, such as buckwheat honey, are the richest in antioxidants). but it\'s not all sweet news. though it\'s a good substitute for sugar, honey is definitely not low-cal. it\'s got 19 more calories per tablespoon than sugar does. how\'s that for sticky? fruit juice concentrates. fruit juice concentrates, such as white grape and apple, are a safe (if not low-calorie) sweetener to turn to during pregnancy. you can substitute them for the sugar in many recipes, and they\'re readily available in frozen form at the supermarket. look for them in commercial products, too, from jams and jellies to whole grain cookies, muffins, cereals, and granola bars, to pop-up toaster pastries, yogurt, and sparkling sodas. unlike most products sweetened with sugar or other sugar substitutes, many fruit-juice-sweetened products are made with nutritious ingredients, such as whole grain flour and healthy fats.","title" : "a gut check about fermented foods"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 318,"author"

not-and some, such as red raspberry leaf, taken in very large amounts (more than four 8-ounce cups a day), are thought to trigger contractions (good if you\'re 40 weeks and impatient, not good if you

guide to help you decide what to drop into your shopping cart and what to pass up: ? choose your foods from the pregnancy diet. because it steers away from processed foods, this eating plan steers you clear of many questionable and unsafe substances. it also supplies green leafies and yellows, rich in protective beta-carotene, as well as other fruits and vegetables rich in phyto-chemicals, which may counteract the effects of toxins in food. ? whenever possible, cook from scratch with fresh ingredients or use frozen or packaged organic ready-to-eat foods. you\'ll avoid many questionable additives found in processed foods, and your meals will be more nutritious, too. ? go as natural as you can, when you can. whenever you have a choice (and you won\'t always), choose foods that are free of artificial additives (colorings, flavorings, and preservatives). read labels to screen for foods that are either additive-free or use natural additives (a cheddar cheese cracker that gets its orange hue from annatto instead of red dye #40, and its flavor from real cheese instead of artificial cheese flavoring). keep in mind that although some artificial additives are considered safe, others are of questionable safety, and many are used to enhance foods that aren\'t very nutritious to start with. (for a listing of questionable and safe additives, go to cspinet.org). ? generally avoid foods preserved with nitrates and nitrites (or sodium nitrates), including many varieties of hot dogs, salami, bologna, and smoked fish and meats. look for those brands (you\'ll find plenty on the market these days) that do not include these preservatives. any ready-cooked meats or smoked fish should be heated to steaming before eating (not to avoid chemicals, but to avoid listeria; see page 118). ? choose lean cuts of meat and remove visible fat before cooking, since chemicals that livestock ingest tend to concentrate in the fat of the animal. with poultry, remove both the fat and the skin to minimize chemical intake. and for the same reason, don\'t eat organ meats (such as liver and kidneys) very often, unless your meat or poultry is organic. ? when it\'s available and your budget permits, buy meat and poultry that has been raised organically (or grass-fed), without hormones or antibiotics (remember, you eat what your dinner ate). choose organic dairy products and eggs, when possible, for the same reason. free-range chickens (and eggs) are not only less likely to be contaminated with chemicals, but are also less likely to carry such infections as salmonella because the birds are not kept in cramped, disease-breeding quarters. and here\'s a plus when it comes to grass-fed beef: it\'s likely to be lower in calories and fat, higher in protein, and a better source of those baby-friendly omega-3 fatty acids. ?

while not necessarily more nutritious, \"biodynamic\" produce (you\'ll notice the labels in some health food stores) is certified to be grown, processed, and brought to market in a way that is healthy for the planet. and that\'s a win-win-win-healthy for you, healthy for your baby, and healthy for the world your baby is about to be born into. the catch: the price, which can be hefty (consumer demand for both organic and biodynamic products will help bring those prices down). ? give all vegetables and fruits a bath. washing produce thoroughly is important no matter what (even organic produce can wear a coating of bacteria), but it\'s key to removing chemical pesticides your fruits and veggies may have picked up in the field. water will wash off some, but a dip in or a spray with produce wash will take off much more (rinse thoroughly afterward). scrub skins when possible and practical to remove surface chemical residues, especially when a vegetable has a waxy coating (as cucumbers and sometimes tomatoes, apples, peppers, and eggplant do). peel skins that still seem \"coated\" after washing. ?

go local. locally grown produce is likely to contain more nutrients (it\'s fresh from the field) and possibly sport less pesticide residue. many of the growers at your local farmers market may grow without pesticides (or with very little), even if their products aren\'t marked \"organic.\" that\'s because certification is too expensive for some small growers to afford. ?

serious illness (listeriosis) in high-risk individuals, including young children, the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women, whose immune systems are also somewhat suppressed. though the overall risk of contracting listeriosis is extremely low-even in pregnancy- the potential of it causing problems in pregnancy is higher. listeria, unlike many other germs, enters the bloodstream directly and therefore can get to the baby quickly through the placenta (other food contaminants generally stay in the digestive tract and may pose a threat only if they get into the amniotic fluid). so, clearly, it\'s important to prevent infection in the first place by staying away from the risky foods that might possibly carry listeria. these include cold cuts (deli

so why call this week 1 of pregnancy if you\'re not even pregnant? here\'s why. it\'s extremely hard to pinpoint the precise moment when sperm meets egg (sperm from your partner can hang out in your body for several days before your egg comes out to greet it, and your egg can wait for up to 24 hours for sperm to make their appearance). what isn\'t hard to pinpoint, however, is the first day of your last menstrual period (lmp-so mark the calendar), allowing your practitioner to use that as the standard starting line for your 40-week pregnancy. the upshot of this dating system (besides a lot of potential for confusion)? you get to clock in 2 weeks of your 40 weeks of pregnancy before you even get pregnant. week 2 nope, still no baby yet. but your body isn\'t taking a break this week. in fact, it\'s working hard gearing up for the big o-ovulation. the lining of your uterus is thickening (feathering its nest for the arrival of the fertilized egg), and your ovarian follicles are maturing-some faster than others-until one becomes dominant, destined for ovulation. and waiting in that dominant follicle is an eager egg with your baby\'s name on it (or, if you\'re about to conceive fraternal twins, 2 eager eggs will be waiting in 2 follicles)-ready to burst out and begin its journey from single cell to bouncing boy or girl. but first it will have to make a journey down your fallopian tube in search of mr. right- the lucky sperm that will seal the deal. week 3 congratulations-you\'ve conceived! which means your baby-to-be has started its miraculous transformation from single cell to fully formed baby boy or girl. within hours after sperm meets egg, the fertilized cell (aka zygote) divides, and then continues to divide (and divide). within days, your baby-to-be has turned into a microscopic ball of cells, around one-fifth the size of the period at the end of this sentence. the blastocyst-as it is now known (though you\'ll almost certainly come up with a cuter name soon)- begins its journey from your fallopian tube to your waiting uterus. only 8� more months-give or take-to go! week 4 it\'s implantation time! that ball of cells that you\'ll soon call baby- though it\'s now called embryo-has reached your uterus and is snuggling into the uterine lining, where it\'ll stay connected to you until delivery. once firmly in place, the ball of cells undergoes the great divide-splitting into 2 groups. half will become your son or daughter, while the other half will become the placenta, your baby\'s lifeline during his or her uterine stay. and even though it\'s just a ball of cells right now (no bigger than a poppy seed, actually), don\'t underestimate your little embryo-he or she has already come a long way since those blastocyst days. the amniotic sac-otherwise known as the bag of waters-is forming, as is the yolk sac, which will later be incorporated into your baby\'s developing digestive tract. each layer of the embryo-it has 3 now-is beginning to grow into specialized parts of the body. the inner layer, known as the endoderm, will develop into your baby\'s digestive system, liver, and lungs. the middle layer, called the mesoderm, will soon be your baby\'s heart, sex organs, bones, kidneys, and muscles. the outer layer, or ectoderm, will eventually form your baby\'s nervous system, hair, skin, and eyes. your baby,

prenatal, even though i eat pretty well?\" v irtually no one gets a nutritionally perfect diet every day-especially early in pregnancy, when round-the-clock morning sickness is a common appetite suppressant, or when the little nutrition you do manage to get down often doesn\'t stay down, or when aversions kill your taste for anything remotely healthy. though a daily prenatal supplement can\'t take the place of a good prenatal diet, it can serve as some dietary insurance, guaranteeing that your baby won\'t be cheated if you don\'t always hit the nutritional mark you\'re aiming for-especially during the early months, when so much of your baby\'s most crucial construction occurs. and there are other good reasons to take your prenatals. for one thing, studies show that taking a supplement containing folic acid and vitamin b12 during the first months of pregnancy (especially if it\'s started in the months before pregnancy) significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects (such as spina bifida), congenital heart defects, and autism in a baby, and helps prevent preterm birth. for another, research has shown that taking a supplement containing at least 10 mg of vitamin b6 before and during early pregnancy can minimize morning sickness. and yet another: many women are deficient in vitamin d (you can ask your practitioner about testing for d deficiency)- and taking a prenatal can help bump up your d levels to where they should be. which prenatal should you take? since there are an overwhelming number of formulations on the market (available both over-the-counter and by prescription), it\'s always a good idea to ask your practitioner to recommend or prescribe one. if size matters to you (say, you find that the typical horse-size prenatal supplement is hard to gag down) ask for one that\'s smaller, coated, or a gel cap. or look into ditching the pill entirely-formulas come in powder, gummy, or chewable form, too (just ask first, since not all prenatals are equivalent). a slow-release formula may prove less upsetting to your pregnancy-sensitive tummy, especially if you\'ve been hit hard by morning sickness, and added b6 and/or ginger may help ease quease, too. taking the supplement with food or at the time of the day when you\'re least likely to upchuck it (maybe after dinner, before bed) may also help you get it (and keep it) down. if you decide to switch prenatals from one that your practitioner recommended or prescribed to one that\'s easier for you to take, run the formula by your practitioner first. any prenatal you choose should approximate the requirements for prenatal supplements (see page 100 for details). some moms-to-be find the iron in a prenatal vitamin causes constipation or diarrhea. again, switching formulas may bring relief. taking a prenatal without iron and adding an iron supplement as prescribed (you probably won\'t require extra iron until midway through pregnancy) may also help. your practitioner can suggest an iron supplement that\'s easier on the tummy. \"i eat a lot of cereals and breads that are enriched. if i\'m also taking a prenatal supplement, will i be taking in too

blood, your heart rate is up, your blood sugar is down, your metabolism is burning energy overtime (even when you\'re lying down), and you\'re using up more nutrients and water. and if that\'s not enough to wear you out, just toss into the draining equation all the other physical and emotional demands of pregnancy that your body is adjusting to. add it all up, and it\'s no wonder you feel as if you\'re competing in a triathlon each day-and coming in dead last (or at least, dead tired). happily, there is some relief headed your way-eventually. once the herculean task of manufacturing the placenta is complete (around the 4th month) and your body has adjusted to the hormonal and emotional changes pregnancy brings, you\'ll feel a little peppier. in the meantime, keep in mind that fatigue is a sensible signal from your body that you need to take it easier these days. so listen up, and get the rest your body needs. you may also be able to recapture some of that get-up-and-go with some of the following tips: baby yourself. if you\'re a first-time mom-to-be, enjoy what will probably be your last chance for a long while to focus on taking care of yourself without feeling guilty. if you already have children at home, you\'ll definitely have to divide your focus. but either way, this is not a time to strive for supermom-to-be status. getting enough rest is more important than keeping your house spotless or cooking 4-star dinners (or cooking dinner at all-that\'s what takeout was created for). let the dishes wait until later, and turn the other way as the dust bunnies breed under your dining table. order your groceries (and anything else you can think of) online instead of dragging yourself to the store. if it\'s affordable for you, become a regular on the grubhub or seamless (or other food delivery services) circuit, and tap into taskrabbit (or others like it) to outsource errands. don\'t book activities-or take care of chores-that aren\'t must-do\'s. never been a slacker? there\'s never been a better time to try it on for size. let others baby you. you\'ll be doing plenty of heavy lifting in the months to come, so your partner will need to be doing his fair share (how does more than half sound?) of household chores, including laundry and grocery shopping. accept your mother-in-law\'s offer to cook dinner when she\'s visiting. have a pal pick up some essentials for you while she\'s going on a shopping run anyway. that way, you might actually have enough energy left to drag yourself out for a walk . . . before you drag yourself into bed. chill out more. exhausted once the day\'s over? spend evenings chilling out (preferably with your feet up) instead of stepping out. and don\'t wait until nightfall to take it easy. if you can squeeze in a nap, by all means go for it. if you can\'t sleep, lie down and rest. if you\'re a working mom-to-be, a nap at the office may not be an option, of course, unless you have a flexible schedule and access to a comfortable sofa, but putting your feet up at your desk or on the sofa in the break room during downtimes and lunch hours may be possible. (if you choose to rest at lunch hour, make sure you make time to eat, too.) be a slacker mom. have other kids? you may be extra tired, for obvious reasons (you have less time to rest, more demands on your body). or fatigue may be less noticeable, since you\'re already accustomed to exhaustion-or too busy to pay attention to it. either way, it\'s not easy babying yourself when you have other babies (and older children) clamoring for your attention. but try. explain to them that growing a baby is hard work and it\'s leaving you beat. ask for their help around the house and their help in letting you get more rest. spend more time at quiet pursuits with your kids-reading, doing puzzles, being the patient in a game of \"doctor\" (you\'ll get to lie down), watching movies. napping when you\'re mothering full-time may also be difficult, but if you can time your rest with naptime (if they still nap), you may be able to swing it. push up your bedtime. it may be stating the obvious, but just in case: getting even an hour more sleep at night can pick you up come morning. just don\'t overdo the dozing-too many z\'s can actually leave you feeling even more tired. eat well. to keep your energy up, you need a steady supply of premium fuel. make sure you\'re getting enough calories each day and focus on the long-lasting energy boosting combo of protein and complex carbs. caffeine or sugar (or both, taken together) may seem like the perfect quick fix for an energy slump, but they\'re not. though a candy bar or a jolt-in-a-can energy drink might pick you up briefly, that blood sugar high will be followed by a free-falling crash, leaving you dragging more than ever. (plus, many canned energy drinks may contain dietary supplements that aren\'t safe for pregnancy use.) eat often. like so many other pregnancy symptoms, fatigue responds well to the 6-meal solution (see page 89). keeping your blood sugar on an even keel will help keep your energy steady, too-so resist meal skipping, and opt for frequent mini-meals and snacks. take a hike. or a slow jog. or a stroll to the grocery store. or do a pregnancy exercise or yoga routine. sure, the couch has never looked more inviting-but paradoxically, too much rest and not enough activity can be a drag on your energy reserves. even a little exercise (a 10-minute walk, or even 5 minutes of what to expect when you\'re expecting: the workout dvd) can be more rejuvenating than a sofa break. just don\'t overdo it-you want to finish up your workout feeling energized, not drained-and be sure to follow the guidelines starting on page 231. though your growing fatigue will probably ease up by month 4, you can expect it to return in the last trimester.

(generalities never hold true for every expectant mom, though, and some women are queasier in subsequent pregnancies than they were in their first.) one thing that\'s likely not a contributing factor to whether or not you\'ll have the pregnancy queasies: the sex of your baby. sure, some moms swear that morning sickness is worse when they\'re expecting a girl than when they\'re carrying a boy. but there are just as many moms who swear the opposite and say they never had a queasy day when they were pregnant with their girls. there is some evidence that moms-to-be who have severe vomiting during pregnancy may be a bit more likely to have a baby girl on board, but experts say these findings don\'t apply to average morning sickness. no matter the cause (and does it really matter, when you\'re upchucking for the third time in one day?), there is no sure cure for the queasies but the passing of time. luckily there are ways to minimize the misery while you\'re waiting for a less nauseous day to dawn: ? eat early. morning sickness doesn\'t wait for you to get up in the morning. in fact, nausea\'s most likely to strike when you\'re running on empty, as you are after a long night\'s sleep. that\'s because when you haven\'t eaten in a while, the acids churning around inside your empty tummy have nothing to digest but your stomach lining-which, not surprisingly, increases queasiness. to head off heaving, don\'t even consider getting out of bed in the morning without reaching for a nibble (crackers or rice cakes, dry cereal, a handful of trail mix) that you stashed on your nightstand the night before. keeping nibbles next to the bed also means you don\'t have to get up for them if you wake up hungry in the middle of the night. it\'s a good idea to have a bite when you rise for those midnight bathroom runs, too, just so your stomach stays a little bit full all night long. ? eat late. eating a light snack high in protein and complex carbs (a muffin and a glass of milk, string cheese and a handful of freeze-dried mango) just before you go to sleep will help ensure a happier tummy when you wake up. ? eat light. a stuffed tummy is just as prone to puking as an empty one. overloading-even when you feel hungry-can lead to upchucking. ? eat often. one of the best ways to keep nausea at bay is to keep your blood sugar on an even keel-and your stomach a little filled-all the time. to head off an attack of the queasies, join the graze craze. eat small, frequent meals-6 mini-meals a day is ideal- instead of 3 large ones. don\'t leave home without a stash of snacks that your tummy can handle (dried fruit and nuts, freeze-dried fruit, granola bars, dry cereal, crackers, pretzels, moon cheese). ? eat well. a diet high in protein and complex carbohydrates can help combat queasiness. general good nutrition may help, too, so eat as well as you can (given the circumstances, that might not always be so easy). ? eat what you can. so the eating well thing isn\'t working out so well for you? f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "morning sickness"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 338,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "morning sickness is one pregnancy symptom that definitely doesn\'t live up to its name. it\'s a 24/7 experience that can send your spouse running to the bathroom morning, noon, and night-and hugging the toilet far more than she\'ll be hugging you. so take steps to help her feel better-or at least not worse. lose the aftershave that she suddenly finds repulsive, and get your onion ring fix out of her sniffing range (thanks to her hormones, her sense of smell is supersized). fill her gas tank so she doesn\'t have to come nose-to-nozzle with the fumes at the pump. fetch her foods that quell her quea-sies and don\'t provoke another run to the toilet. good choices include ginger ale, soothing smoothies, and crackers (but ask first-what spells r-e-l-i-e-f for one queasy woman spells v-o-m-i-t for another). encourage her to eat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 large ones (spreading out the load and keeping her tummy filled may ease her nausea), but don\'t chide her for her food choices (now\'s not the time to nag her about eating her broccoli). be there for support when she\'s throwing up- hold back her hair, bring her some ice water, rub her back. and remember, no jokes. if you were throwing up for weeks, you wouldn\'t find it amusing. not surprisingly, neither does she. right now, getting anything in your tummy-and keeping it there-should be your priority. there will be plenty of time later on in your pregnancy for eating well. for the queasy moment, eat whatever gets you through the day (and night), even if it\'s nothing but ice pops and gingersnaps. if you can manage to make them real fruit ice pops and whole grain gingersnaps, great. if you can\'t, that\'s fine, too. ? drink up. in the short term, getting enough fluids is more important than getting enough solids-particularly if you\'re losing lots of liquids through vomiting. if you\'re finding that liquids are easier to get down when you\'re feeling green, use them to get your nutrients. drink your vitamins and minerals in soothing smoothies, soups, and juices. if you find fluids make you queasier, eat solids with a high water content, such as fresh fruits and vegetables-particularly melons (watermelon\'s a winner) and citrus fruits. some queasy moms-to-be find that drinking and eating at the same meal puts too much strain on their digestive tract-if this is true for you, try taking your fluids between meals. both electrolyte water and coconut water may be especially helpful if you\'re vomiting a lot. ? get chilly. experiment with tem- perature, too. many women find that icy-cold fluids and foods are easier to get down. others favor warm ones (melted cheese sandwiches instead of cold ones). ? switch off. often, what starts out as a comfort food (it\'s the only thing you can keep down, so you eat it 24/7) becomes associated with nausea-and actually starts to trigger it. if you\'re so sick of crackers that they\'re actually beginning to make you sick, switch off to another comforting carb (maybe it\'ll be cheerios next). ? if it makes you queasy, don\'t go there. period. don\'t force yourself to eat any foods that don\'t appeal or, worse, make you sick. instead, let your taste buds (and cravings, and aversions) be your guide. choose only sweet foods if they\'re all you can tolerate (get your vitamin a and protein from peaches and yogurt at dinner instead of from broccoli and chicken). or select only savories if they\'re your ticket to a less tumultuous tummy (have pizza for breakfast instead of cereal). ? smell (and see) no evil. thanks to a much more sensitive sense of smell, pregnant women often find once-appetizing aromas suddenly offensive-and offensive ones downright sickening. so stay away from smells that trigger nausea-whether it\'s the sausage and eggs your partner likes to make on the weekends or his aftershave that used to make you head over heels (but now makes you head for the toilet). steer clear, too, of foods that you can\'t stand the sight of (raw chicken is a common culprit). ? supplement. take a prenatal supple- ment to compensate for nutrients you may not be getting. afraid you\'ll have trouble choking the pill down-or keeping it down? actually, that one-a-day can decrease nausea symptoms (especially if you take a slow-releasing vitamin that\'s higher in quease-combating vitamin b6). but take it at a time of day when you are least likely to heave it back up, possibly with a substantial bedtime snack. you can also ask your practitioner about taking extra vitamin b6 (with or without unisom sleeptabs, or another otc version of the antihistamine doxyl-amine), and/or supplementing with magnesium (or using a magnesium spray), which some say can help ease pregnancy nausea. ? tread gingerly. it\'s true what the old wives (and midwives) have been saying for centuries: ginger can be good for what ails a queasy pregnant woman. use ginger in cooking (carrot-ginger soup, ginger muffins), steep it in tea, nibble on some ginger biscuits, nosh on some crystallized ginger, or suck on some ginger candy or lollipops. a drink made from real ginger (regular ginger ale isn\'t always, so check the label) may also be soothing. even the smell of fresh ginger (cut open a knob and take a whiff) may quell the queasies. or try another trick of the queasy trade: lemons. many women find both the smell and taste of lemons comforting (when life gives you morning sickness, make lemonade?). sour or peppermint flavored sucking candies spell relief for others. or try sipping on icy-cold almond milk, also touted for its tummy-settling benefits (it works on heartburn, too). ? rest up. get some extra sleep, since fatigue can step up that sick feeling.","title" : "helping ease her quease"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 339,"author" :

bloodhound syndrome can also ramp up morning sickness symptoms. smell trouble? give your nose a break. here are some strategies to try: ? if you can\'t stand the smell, get out of the kitchen. or the restaurant. or the perfume aisle at sephora. or anywhere odors that sicken you hang out. ? make friends with your microwave. microwave cooking generally makes less of a stink. ? too late-there\'s already a stink? open your windows whenever possible to banish cooking or musty odors. or run the exhaust fan on the stove. ? wash your clothes more often than usual, since fibers tend to hold on to odors. use unscented detergent and softener, though, if the scented ones bother you (same goes for all your cleaning supplies). ? switch to unscented or lightly scented toiletries (or scents that don\'t make you sick). ? ask those who are regularly within sniffing distance of you (and who you know well enough to ask) to be extra-considerate of your sensitive smell status. get your spouse to wash up, change his clothes, and brush his teeth after stopping for a chili cheeseburger. suggest that pals go easy on the perfume when they\'re with you. ? try to surround yourself with those scents (if there are any) that actually make you feel better. mint, lemon, ginger, and cinnamon are more likely to be soothing, especially if you\'re queasy, though some expectant moms suddenly embrace smells that invoke infants, such as baby powder. ? go slow-mo. don\'t jump out of bed and dash out the door-rushing tends to aggravate nausea. instead, linger in bed for a few minutes, nibbling on that bedside snack, then rise slowly to a leisurely breakfast. this may seem impossible if you have other children, but try to wake up before they do so you can sneak in some quiet time, or let daddy do the dawn shift. ? minimize stress. easing the stress can ease the quease. see page 145 for tips on dealing with stress. ? treat your mouth well. brush your teeth (with a toothpaste that doesn\'t increase queasiness) or rinse your mouth after each bout of vomiting, as well as after each meal (ask your dentist to recommend a good rinse). this will not only help keep your mouth fresh and reduce nausea, but decrease the risk of damage to teeth or gums that can occur when bacteria feast on regurgitated residue in your mouth. ? try sea-bands. these 1-inch-wide elastic bands, worn on both wrists, put pressure on acupressure points on the inner wrists and often relieve nausea. they cause no side effects and are widely available at drug and health food stores. or your practitioner may recommend a more sophisticated form of acupressure: a battery-operated wristband that uses electronic stimulation, like relief bands or psi bands. ? consider cam. a wide variety of complementary medical approaches, such as acupuncture, acupressure, biofeedback, meditation, or hypnosis, can help minimize the symptoms of morning sickness-and they\'re all worth a try (see page 78). ? ask about medication. if the do-it- yourself tips don\'t do the trick, check with your practitioner about whether you might need to step up to a prescription approach. diclegis (diclectin in canada) is a very safe and effective combination of the antihistamine doxylamine and vitamin b6 (the same combo often recommended in otc form) in a delayed-release formula that can ease symptoms of morning sickness throughout the day and night with less daytime drowsiness. if morning sickness is really severe, antinausea medication may be added (such as phenergan, reglan, or scopolamine). but don\'t take any medication (traditional or herbal) for morning sickness unless it is prescribed by your practitioner. in fewer than 5 percent of pregnancies, nausea and vomiting become so severe that medical intervention may be needed. if this seems to be the case with you, check in with your practitioner and see page 547.","title" : "your nose knows"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 340,"author" : "heidi

hallway free of obstacles (your gym backpack, your sneakers) and lit by a nightlight so she won\'t trip on her way to the toilet. and be as understanding as you can (read: no eye rolling) when she has to get up 3 times during the movie or stop 6 times on the way to your parents\' house. keep in mind that urinary frequency is not in her control (sometimes literally) and that frequently trying to hold in her pee can lead to a urinary tract infection. your body rid itself of waste products more quickly (including baby\'s, which means you\'ll be peeing for two). finally, your growing uterus is pressing on your bladder now, leaving less storage space in the holding tank for urine and triggering that \"gotta go\" feeling. this pressure is often relieved once the uterus rises into the abdominal cavity during the second trimester and doesn\'t usually return until the third trimester or when the baby\'s head \"drops\" back down into the pelvis in the 9th month (bringing you urinary frequency: the sequel). but because the arrangement of internal organs varies slightly from woman to woman, the degree of urinary frequency in pregnancy may also vary. some women barely notice it, and others are bothered by it for most of the 9 months. leaning forward when you urinate will help ensure that you empty your bladder completely, as will double voiding (pee, then when you\'re finished, squeeze out some more). both tactics may reduce the number of trips to the bathroom, though realistically, not by much. don\'t cut back on liquids, thinking it\'ll keep you out of the bathroom. your body and your baby need a steady supply of fluids-plus, dehydration can lead to a uti. but do cut back on caffeine, since large quantities can increase the need to pee (and that fierce urgency of \"now!\"). if you find that you go frequently during the night, try limiting fluids right before bedtime. if you\'re always feeling the urge to urinate (even after you\'ve just peed), talk to your practitioner. he or she might want to run a test to see if you\'ve got a uti. \"how come i\'m not urinating frequently?\" m aybe you\'re not noticing an increase in urination because you\'re already a frequent pee-er-or because you\'re just not keeping track. but do make sure you\'re getting enough fluids. too little fluid intake cannot only cause infrequent urination, but lead to dehydration and

way, and will they sag after i give birth?\" looks like you\'ve discovered the first big thing in pregnancy: your breasts. while bellies don\'t usually do much growing until the second trimester, breasts often begin their expansion within weeks of conception, gradually working their way through the bra cup alphabet, sometimes into double- and triple-letter territory (you may ultimately end up 3 cup sizes bigger than you started out). fueling this growth are those surging hormones-the same ones that boost your bust premenstrually but at much greater levels. fat is building up in your breasts, too, and blood flow to the area is increasing. and there\'s a swell reason for all this swelling-your breasts are gearing up to feed your baby when he or she arrives. in addition to their expanding size, you will probably notice other changes to your breasts. the areola (the pigmented area around the nipple) will darken and spread, and may be spotted with even darker areas. this darkening may fade but not disappear entirely after birth. the little bumps you may notice on the areola are lubrication glands, which become more prominent during pregnancy and return to normal afterward. the complex road map of blue veins that spreads over the breasts-often vivid on a fair-skinned woman and sometimes not even noticeable on darker women-represents a mom-to-baby delivery system for nutrients and fluids. after delivery-or, if you\'re breastfeeding, sometime after baby\'s weaned-the skin\'s appearance will return to normal. fortunately, that cup-size gain won\'t continue to come with pain (or uncomfortable sensitivity). though your breasts will probably keep growing throughout your 9 months, they\'re not likely to stay super tender to the touch past the 3rd or 4th month. some women find that most tenderness eases well before that. in the achy meantime, find relief in cool or warm compresses (whichever is more soothing). as for whether or not your breasts will end up sagging, a lot of that is up to genetics (if your mom drooped, you may, too), but some of it\'s up to you. sagging results not just from pregnancy itself but from a lack of support during pregnancy. no matter how perky your breasts are now, protect them from a floppy future by wearing a supportive bra (though in that tender first trimester, you may want to avoid restrictive

caused by one of the following: implantation of the embryo. affecting 20 to 30 percent of women, such spotting (called \"implantation bleeding\" in the ob business) will usually occur before (or in some cases around the time) you expected your period, about 6 to 12 days after conception. lighter than a period (and lasting anywhere from a few hours to a few days), implantation bleeding is usually

(make that, most expectant moms) will always find something to worry about-especially in the first trimester and particularly in first pregnancies. topping the list of most common concerns, understandably, is a fear of miscarriage. fortunately, most expectant worriers end up worrying unnecessarily. most pregnancies continue uneventfully, and happily, to term. just about every normal pregnancy includes some cramps, some abdominal aches, or some spotting-and many include all three. while any of these symptoms can be understandably unnerving (and when it comes to a stain on your underwear, downright scary), more often than not, they\'re completely innocuous-and not a sign that your pregnancy is in trouble. though you should report them to your practitioner at your next visit (or sooner if you need some professional reassurance), the following are no cause for concern. so don\'t worry if you have: mild cramps, achiness, or a pulling sensation in the lower abdomen on one or both sides. early on, this is probably related to implantation, the increased blood flow to the region, the buildup of your uterine lining, or just all the growing that\'s going on as your uterus and the ligaments that support it begin stretching. unless cramping is severe, constant, or accompanied by significant bleeding, there\'s no need to worry. slight spotting that isn\'t accompanied by cramps or lower abdominal pain. there are plenty of reasons why pregnant women spot, and it often has nothing to do with a miscarriage. see facing page for more on spotting. of course, it\'s not just symptoms that pregnant women worry about in early pregnancy-it\'s a lack of symptoms, too. in fact, not \"feeling pregnant\" is one of the most commonly reported first-trimester concerns. and that\'s not surprising. it\'s hard to feel pregnant this early on, even if you\'re experiencing every early pregnancy symptom in the book-and it\'s far harder still to feel pregnant if you\'re relatively symptom-free. without tangible proof yet of that baby-to-be growing inside you (a swelling belly, those first flutters of movement), it\'s pretty easy to start wondering whether the pregnancy is going well-or whether you\'re even still pregnant. once again, not to worry. a lack of symptoms-such as morning sickness or breast tenderness-is not usually a sign that something\'s wrong. consider yourself lucky if you\'re spared these and other unpleasant early-pregnancy symptoms-and also consider that you might be a late bloomer. after all, since every pregnant woman experiences pregnancy symptoms differently and at different times, these and other symptoms may be just around the corner for you. spotting is as variable in a normal pregnancy as it is common. some women spot on and off for their entire pregnancies. other women spot for just a day or two-and still others for several weeks. some women notice mucousy brown or pink spotting, others see small amounts of bright red blood. but happily, most women who experience any kind of spotting continue to have completely normal and healthy pregnancies and end up delivering perfectly healthy babies. which means that there\'s probably nothing for you to worry about (though, realistically, that doesn\'t mean you\'ll stop worrying). for extra reassurance, put in a call to your practitioner (no need to call immediately or outside of office hours unless your spotting is accompanied by cramping or bright red, soak-through-a-pad bleeding). he or she will likely either order a blood test to check hcg levels (see next question) or perform an ultrasound (or do both). if you\'re past the 6th week, you\'ll probably be able to see your baby\'s heartbeat during the ultrasound, which will reassure you that your pregnancy is progressing along just fine, even with the spotting. what if the spotting progresses to heavier bleeding similar to a period? though such a scenario is more cause for concern (especially if it\'s accompanied by cramps or pain in your lower abdomen) and does warrant an immediate call to your practitioner, it\'s not a sign that you\'re inevitably miscarrying. some women bleed-even heavily-for unknown reasons throughout their pregnancies and still deliver healthy babies. if it does end up that you\'re having a miscarriage, see page 582.","title" : "no worries"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

your hpt) and in your blood, which explains why your practitioner ran a blood test to find out your expectant status for sure. when you\'re very early in the pregnancy game (as you are), the level of hcg in your blood will be quite low (it\'s just starting to show up in your system, after all). but within days, it\'ll begin to soar, doubling every 48 hours (give or take). the rapid increase peaks somewhere between 7 and 12 weeks of pregnancy and then starts to decline. but don\'t start swapping your numbers with mama-to-be buddies. just as no two women\'s pregnancies are alike, no two pregnant women\'s hcg levels are alike, either. they vary from day to day, mom to mom, even as early as the first missed day of a period and continuing throughout pregnancy. what\'s more important and relevant to you is that your hcg level falls within the very wide normal range (see box, facing page) and continues to increase over the coming weeks (in other words, look for a pattern of increasing levels instead of focusing on specific numbers). even if your readings fall outside these ranges, don\'t worry. it\'s still quite likely that everything\'s fine. your due date might just be off-a very common cause of hcg number confusion-or, less probably, you might be carrying twins. as long as your pregnancy is progressing normally and your hcg levels are increasing during the first trimester, there\'s no need to obsess about these numbers or even try to find them out (plus, if your practitioner is happy with your numbers, then you can be, too). ultrasound findings after 5 or 6 weeks of pregnancy

research shows that pregnancy isn\'t affected by typical stress levels. if you\'re able to cope well with your everyday stress (even if it\'s more than most people could take on), then your baby will

possible care of yourself, your baby, and your pregnancy. that said, too much stress-or stress that isn\'t well managed-can take its toll, particularly if it continues into the second and third trimesters. which means that learning how to handle stress constructively, or cutting back on it as needed, should become a priority now. the following should help: unload it. allowing your anxieties to surface is the best way of ensuring that they don\'t get you down. make sure you have somewhere to vent-and someone to vent to. maintain open lines of communication with your spouse, spending some time at the end of each day (preferably not too close to bedtime, which should be as stress-free as possible) sharing concerns and frustrations. together you may be able to find some relief, some

life changes, no doubt about it-and all expectant parents worry about them. thinking about them-and even stressing about them a little-now is actually a really good thing, since it gives you a chance to prepare realistically for the impact parenthood will have on your life. the most common dad-to-be worries include: will our relationship change? let\'s get real: yes, your relationship will change. from the moment baby comes into your life, spontaneous intimacy and complete privacy will be precious, and often unattainable, commodities. romance may have to be planned (during baby\'s nap) rather than spur of the moment, and interruptions may be the rule. but as long as you both make the effort to make time for each other-whether that means catching up over a late dinner once baby\'s in bed, or giving up a game with the guys so you can play games of an entirely different kind with your partner, or starting a weekly date night-your relationship will weather the changes well. many couples, in fact, find that becoming a threesome deepens, strengthens, and improves their twosome-bringing them closer together than they\'ve ever been before. how will work be affected? that depends on your work schedule. if you currently work long hours with little time off, you may need (and want) to make some changes so that fatherhood can become the priority in your life that you\'ll want it to be. and don\'t wait until you officially graduate to dad status. think about taking time off now for prenatal checkups, as well as to help your exhausted spouse with baby preparations. start weaning yourself off those 12-hour days, and resist the temptation to continue your day at the office at home. avoid trips and a heavy workload during the 2 months before and after your baby\'s arrival, if you can. and if it\'s at all possible, consider taking paternity leave in the early weeks of baby\'s life. will we have to give up our lifestyle? you probably won\'t have to say goodbye to activities-as-usual or your social life as you knew it, but you should expect to make some adjustments, at least up front. a new baby does, and should, take center stage, pushing some old lifestyle habits temporarily aside. parties, movies, and sports may be tricky to fit in between feedings, and cozy dinners for two at your favorite bistro may become noisy meals for three at family restaurants that tolerate squirming infants. your circle of friends may change somewhat, too-you may suddenly find yourself gravitating they can be modified. if you\'re clearly trying to do too much, cut back in areas that are not high priority (this is something you\'re going to have to do big time anyway, once you have a bigger priority-a new baby-on the agenda). if you\'ve taken on too many responsibilities at home or at work, decide which can be postponed or delegated. learn to say no to new projects or activities before you\'re overloaded (another skill you\'re wise to cultivate pre-baby). sometimes, making lists of the hundreds of things you need to get done (at home or at work), and the order in which you\'re planning to do them, can help you feel more in control of the chaos in your life. for a satisfying sense of accomplishment, check items off your list as they\'re taken care of. sleep it off. sleep is the ticket to regeneration-for mind and body. often, feelings of tension and anxiety are prompted by not getting enough shuteye-and, of course, having too much tension and anxiety can also prevent you from getting enough shut-eye. so try to break the sleepless-stressed-sleepless cycle. if you\'re having trouble sleeping, see the tips on page 264. nourish it. hectic lifestyles can lead to hectic eating styles. inadequate nutrition during pregnancy can be a double whammy: it can hamper your ability to handle stress, and it can eventually affect your baby\'s wellbeing. so be sure to eat well and regularly (6 mini-meals will best keep you going when the going gets stressful). focus on complex carbs and protein, and steer clear of excessive caffeine and sugar, two staples of the stressed life that can actually leave you less able to cope. wash it away. a warm bath is an excellent way to relieve tension. try it after a stressful day-it will also help you sleep better. run it off. or swim it off. or prenatal yoga it off. you might think that the last thing you need in your life is more activity, but exercise is one of the best stress relievers-and mood boosters. build some into your busy day. toward fellow baby-wearers or stroller-pushers for empathetic companionship. not to say that there won\'t be a place in your new life with baby for old friends who aren\'t fathers-and pastimes from your pre-parent past-just that your priorities will likely do some necessary shifting. can we afford a larger family? with the cost of having and raising a baby going through the roof, many expectant parents lose sleep over this very legitimate question. but there are plenty of ways to cut those costs, including opting for breastfeeding (no bottles or formula to buy) and accepting all the hand-me-downs that are offered (new clothes start to look like hand-me-downs after a few spitting-up episodes anyway). if either of you plan to take extra time off from work (or to put career plans on hold for a while) and this concerns you from a financial standpoint, weigh it against the costs of high-quality child care and commuting. the income lost may not be such a budget buster after all. most important: instead of thinking of what you won\'t have in your life anymore (or won\'t have as much opportunity for), try to start thinking of what you will have in your life: a very special little person to share it with. will your life be different? definitely. will it be better? no doubt about it. cam it. explore the many complementary and alternative therapies that can promise inner calm, among them biofeedback, acupuncture,

take a turn for the better (when lackluster hair suddenly sports a brilliant shine) or for the worse (when once-bouncy hair goes limp). one thing\'s probably for sure: thanks to hormones, you\'ll have more of it than ever before (and sadly, probably not just on your head). here\'s the heads-up on hair treatments: coloring. here\'s the root of the problem when it comes to hiding your roots during pregnancy. even though no evidence suggests the small amount of chemicals absorbed through the skin during hair coloring is harmful when you\'re expecting, some experts still advise waiting out the first trimester before heading back to the salon (or reaching for your favorite drugstore formula) for retouching. others maintain that it\'s safe to dye throughout pregnancy. check with your practitioner-you\'ll likely get the green light on color. if you\'re uncomfortable with a full dye job, consider highlights instead of single-process color. that way the chemicals won\'t touch your scalp at all, plus highlights tend to last longer than all-over color, which means you\'ll need fewer retouches during your pregnancy. you can also ask your colorist (or beauty supply store) about less harsh processing-an ammonia-free base or an all-vegetable dye, for instance. just keep in mind that hormonal changes can make your hair react strangely-so you might not get what you expect, even from your regular formula. try a small test area first so you don\'t wind up with a headful of punk purple instead of that ravishing red you were hoping for. straightening treatments or relaxers. thinking about a straightening treatment to calm those curls? though there\'s no evidence that hair relaxers are dangerous during pregnancy (the amount of chemicals that seep through the scalp and into the blood system is probably minimal), there\'s no proof they\'re completely safe, either. ditto for brazilian keratin treatments (many contain formaldehyde, which is probably not safe during pregnancy, plus the fumes can be intense). so check with your practitioner-you may hear that it\'s safest to let your hair do what comes naturally, especially during the first trimester. if you do decide to go straight, keep in mind that there\'s a possibility that your hormone-infused locks may respond oddly to the chemicals (you might end up with a helmet of frizz instead of ramrod-straight tresses). plus, your hair will grow faster during pregnancy, making those curls reappear at your roots sooner than you might like. thermal reconditioning processes that involve different-often gentler- chemicals to tame your frizz may be a safer option (again, ask first). or just buy a flat iron of your own, and coax your hair into smooth submission. permanents or body waves. so your hair\'s not as full as your figure\'s becoming? ordinarily, a permanent or a body wave might be the answer for hair that\'s limping, but it probably isn\'t during pregnancy. not because it isn\'t safe (it probably is, though check with your practitioner), but because hair responds unpredictably under the influence of pregnancy hormones. a permanent might not take at all-or might result in frizz instead of waves. hair removal. if pregnancy has you looking like an extra from planet of the apes, stay calm-this hairy situation is only temporary. your armpits, bikini line, upper lip, even your belly may be fuzzier than usual because of those raging hormones (though some lucky moms-to-be find hair growth on their legs slows down). rather not wear fur? no need to. you can safely turn to all

nothing like a massage to rub away the aches and pains of pregnancy, as well as the stress and strain. but though a massage may be just what the feel-good doctor ordered, you\'ll need to follow some guidelines to ensure your pregnancy massages are not only relaxing but also safe: ? get rubbed by the right hands. make sure your massage therapist is licensed and well versed in the do\'s and don\'ts of prenatal massage. ? wait for your rub. massage during the first 3 months of pregnancy may trigger dizziness and add to morning sickness, so it\'s best to hold off until the second trimester. but don\'t worry if you\'ve already had a massage during your first trimester. ? relax in the right position. it\'s best to avoid spending a lot of time on your back after the 4th month, so ask your massage therapist to use a table that\'s equipped with a cutout for your belly, special pillows designed for pregnancy use, or cushioned foam padding that conforms to your body, or to position you on your side. ? try some non-scents. ask for an unscented lotion or oil, not only because your pregnancy-sharpened sniffer might be offended by strong fragrances, but also because some aromatherapy oils can stimulate contractions (see next page). ? rub the right spots (and stay away from the wrong ones). direct pressure on the area between the anklebone and heel can trigger contractions, so be sure your therapist stays away from there (another good reason to choose a massage therapist with prenatal training). another spot to steer clear of: the abdomen, for both comfort\'s and safety\'s sake (there is a very slight risk that deep abdominal massage could trigger contractions or lead to other complications). and if your therapist is working too deeply or if the massage is too intense, speak up. this is about you feeling good, after all. aromatherapy. when it comes to scents during pregnancy, it\'s good to use some common sense. because the effects of many plant oils in pregnancy are unknown and some may be harmful, approach any kind of aromatherapy with caution. the following essential oils are considered safe for prenatal massage, though experts recommend that they be mixed at a concentration that\'s half the standard usage: rose, lavender, chamomile, jasmine, tangerine, neroli, and ylang-ylang. pregnant women should particularly avoid the following oils, because some of them can trigger uterine contractions: basil, juniper, rosemary, sage, peppermint, pennyroyal, oregano, and thyme. (midwives often use these oils during labor precisely because they may trigger contractions.) if you\'ve had an aromatherapy massage with these oils (or used them in home baths or treatments), don\'t worry. the absorption of the oil is very low, especially because the skin on your back is pretty thick. just steer clear of them in future treatments. scented lotions or beauty products sold at bath and beauty shops (like peppermint foot lotion, for instance) are fine since the scents aren\'t concentrated. body treatments, scrubs, wraps, hydrotherapy. body scrubs are generally safe, as long as they\'re gentle (some scrubs can be too rough on sensitive pregnant skin). some wraps can be safe, but most are off-limits because they might raise your body temperature excessively. a short warm bath (no hotter than 100�f) as part of hydrotherapy is safe and relaxing, but stay out of the sauna, steam room, and hot tub. tanning beds, sprays, lotions. looking for a way to go beyond the pale (pale skin, that is) during your pregnancy? sorry, but tanning beds are out. not only are they bad for your health (they increase your risk of skin cancer), but they speed up the aging process and up your chances of getting chloasma (the skin discoloration called the \"mask of pregnancy\"). worse, tanning beds can raise your body temperature to a level that could be harmful to your developing baby. still a fan of the tan? before you fake it with sunless tanning lotions and sprays, talk to your practitioner. and even if you get the go-ahead, consider that your hormones can cause your skin to play games with the color (and take a turn for the terra cotta). plus, as your belly expands, applying a sunless tanner evenly might get tricky (especially once you can no longer see your legs, and even if

pedicure. it\'s perfectly safe to polish while pregnant (and take advantage now, because it\'s likely that your nails are growing faster and stronger than ever). if you get your nails done in a salon, make sure it\'s a well-ventilated one. inhaling those strong chemical smells is never a good idea but especially not when you\'re breathing for two (and at the very least, the fumes might make you queasy). do be sure the manicurist doesn\'t massage the area between your anklebone and heel when you\'re getting your pedi (it could theoretically trigger contractions). and if you want your calluses removed, have the manicurist do so only with a pumice stone, not a blade (even if it\'s from a sterile pack and is the disposable kind), since that can lead to infection (never mind the fact that the more you cut calluses, the more they grow back). if you\'re worried about the fumes from regular nail polishes, check out the growing number of nontoxic polishes- as well as nontoxic polish removers. when it comes to long-lasting gel or shellac polish, there\'s no proven risk to pregnancy, but there definitely could be to your skin if you\'re not careful. that\'s because the lights sometimes used to cure the gel polish emit uv light-the kind used in tanning booths and that has been implicated in premature aging and skin cancer (plus it could lead to blotchy hands during pregnancy). if you do gels, ask for specially made gloves that cover your hands, exposing only your nails to the uv light (or frequent a nail salon that uses led light that cures far faster). also wise: getting the green light on gels from your practitioner, especially if you\'re thinking of getting them regularly during pregnancy. as for acrylics, there\'s no proof that the chemicals are harmful, but you might want to err on the cautious side and forgo those tips until post-baby- not only because the application smell can be extremely strong, but because they can become a nail bed for infection, something you might be more prone to while you\'re pregnant. and remember, you may not need the extra length or strength of acrylics anyway, because your nails will be growing at warp speed and may be stronger than

most are safe. many of the tips for fighting heartburn can also help with your reflux. from the stomach relaxes (like all the other smooth muscle in the gi tract), allowing food and harsh digestive juices to back up from the stomach to the esophagus. these stomach acids irritate the sensitive esophageal lining, causing a burning sensation right around where the heart is located-thus the term heartburn, though the problem has nothing to do with your heart. during the last 2 trimesters, heartburn can be compounded by your expanding uterus as it presses up on your stomach and crowds out the digestive system. it\'s nearly impossible to have an indigestion-free 9 months-tummy troubles come with the pregnant territory. there are, however, some effective ways of avoiding heartburn and other indigestion most of the time, and of minimizing the misery when it strikes: ? don\'t pull the triggers. if a food or drink brings on the burn (or other tummy troubles), take it off the menu for now. the most common offenders (and you\'re sure to know those that offend you) are spicy and highly seasoned foods, fried or fatty foods, processed meats, chocolate, coffee, carbonated beverages, and mint. ? take it small. to avoid digestive sys- tem overload (and backup of gastric juices), opt for frequent mini-meals over 3 large squares. the 6-meal solution is ideal for heartburn and indigestion sufferers (see page 89). ? take it slow. when you eat too quickly, you tend to swallow air, which can form gas pockets in your belly. and rushing through meals means you\'re not chewing thoroughly, which makes your stomach work harder digesting your food-and makes indigestion more likely to happen. so even when you\'re super hungry or in a super hurry, make an effort to eat slowly, taking small bites and chewing well (your mother would be proud). ? don\'t drink and eat at the same time. too much fluid mixed with your food distends the stomach, aggravating indigestion. so try to drink most of your fluids in between meals. ? keep it up. it\'s harder for gastric juices to back up when you\'re vertical than when you\'re horizontal. to keep them where they belong (down in your stomach), avoid eating while lying down. or lying down after eating-or eating a big meal before bed. sleeping with your head and shoulders elevated about 6 inches can also fight the gastric backup with gravity. another way: when picking something up, bend at the knees, not at the waist. anytime your head dips, you\'re more likely to experience burn.","title" : "bringing up reflux"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" :

keep a supply of tums or rolaids at popping distance (they\'ll also give you a healthy dose of calcium while they ease the burn), but avoid other heartburn medicines unless they\'ve been cleared by your practitioner. ? chew on it. chewing sugarless gum for a half hour after meals can reduce excess acid (increased saliva can neutralize the acid in your esophagus). some people find that mint-flavored gum exacerbates heartburn-if so, choose a non-minty gum. ? add almonds. eat a few almonds after each meal, since these tasty nuts neutralize the juices in the stomach, which may relieve

first, the increased volume of blood you\'re carrying can create significant pressure on blood vessels, causing even tiny veins to swell and become visible. second, pregnancy hormones can do a number on all your blood vessels, big and small. and third, genetics can predispose you to spider veins at any time in life, but especially during pregnancy (thanks, mom). if you\'re destined to have spider veins, there\'s not much you can do to avoid them altogether, but there are ways to minimize their spread. since your veins are as healthy as your diet is, try eating enough vitamin c foods (the body uses it to manufacture collagen and elastin, important connective tissues that help repair and maintain blood vessels). exercising regularly (to improve circulation and leg strength) and getting into the habit of not crossing your legs (which restricts blood flow) will also help keep spider veins at bay. prevention didn\'t do the trick? some, though far from all, spider veins fade and disappear after delivery. if they don\'t, they can be treated by a dermatologist-either with the injection of saline (sclerotherapy) or glycerin, or with the use of a laser. these treatments destroy the blood vessels, causing them to collapse and eventually disappear- but they\'re not cheap and aren\'t recommended during pregnancy. in the meantime, you can try camouflaging your spider veins with a flesh-toned concealer or an \"airbrush\" makeup for legs designed to cover all kinds of imperfections.","title" : "spider veins"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 376,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my mother and grandmother both had varicose veins during pregnancy. is there anything i can do to prevent them in my own pregnancy?\" v aricose veins run in families-and it definitely sounds like they have legs in yours. but being genetically predisposed to varicose veins doesn\'t mean you have to be resigned to them, which is why you\'re wise to be thinking now about bucking this family tradition with prevention. varicose veins often surface for the first time during pregnancy, and they tend to get worse in subsequent pregnancies. that\'s because the extra volume of blood you produce during pregnancy puts extra pressure on your blood vessels, especially the veins in your legs, which have to work against gravity to push all that extra blood back up to your heart. add to that the pressure your ever-heavier uterus will be putting on your pelvic blood vessels and the vessel-relaxing effects of the extra hormones your body is producing, and you have the perfect recipe for varicose veins. the symptoms of varicose veins aren\'t difficult to recognize, but they vary in severity. there may be a mild achiness or severe pain in the legs, or a sensation of heaviness, or swelling, or none of these. a faint outline of bluish veins may be visible, or snakelike veins may bulge from ankle to upper thigh. in severe cases, the skin overlying the veins becomes swollen, dry, and irritated. occasionally, superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a surface vein, caused by a blood clot) may develop at the site of a varicosity, so always check with your practitioner about varicose vein symptoms. to give your legs a leg up against varicose veins: ? keep the blood flowing. too much sitting or standing can compromise blood flow, so avoid long periods of either when you can-and when you can\'t, periodically flex your ankles. when sitting, avoid crossing your legs and elevate them if possible. when lying down, raise your legs by placing a pillow under your feet. when resting or sleeping, try to lie on your left side, the best one for optimum circulation (though either side will do). ? watch your weight. excess pound- age increases the demands on your already overworked circulatory system, so keep your weight gain within the recommended guidelines. ? avoid heavy lifting, which can make those veins bulge. ? push gently during bowel movements. straining on the toilet can be a strain on the deep leg veins, so take steps to avoid constipation. ? wear support panty hose (light sup- port hose seem to work well without being uncomfortable) or elastic stockings. put them on first thing in the morning (before blood pools in your legs) and take them off at night before getting into bed. while wearing support hose probably won\'t contribute to your sexiest pregnancy moment, it may help by counteracting the downward pressure of your belly and giving the veins in your legs a little extra upward push. plus, support hose have come a long way in style and comfort since grandma\'s day. ? stay away from clothes that might restrict your circulation: tight belts or pants, panty hose and socks with elastic tops, and snug shoes. also skip high heels, favoring flats (choose ones with good arch support), medium chunky heels, or low wedges instead. ? get some exercise every day (see page 229). but if you\'re experiencing pain, avoid high-impact cardio, jogging, cycling, and weight training. ? be sure your diet includes plenty of fruit and vegetables rich in vitamin c, which help keep blood vessels healthy and elastic. surgical removal of varicose veins isn\'t recommended during pregnancy, though it can certainly be considered a few months after delivery. in most cases, however, the problem will improve after delivery, usually by the time prepreg-nancy weight is reached.","title" : "varicose veins"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 377,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my whole pelvic area feels achy and swollen, and really uncomfortable-and i think i felt an actual bulge in my vulva. what is that all about?\" l egs may have the market share of varicose veins, but they definitely don\'t have a monopoly. varicose veins can also appear in the pelvic area (in the vulva and the vagina), on the buttocks, and in the rectum, for the same reason you might get them in your legs-and it sounds like they\'ve made that appearance in you. called pelvic congestion to bulging in the vulva) include chronic pelvic pain and/or abdominal pain, an achy, swollen, \"full\" feeling in the pelvic area and the genitals, and sometimes pain with or after intercourse. the tips for minimizing varicose veins in the legs will also help you (see previous question), but do be sure to check with your practitioner, both for the diagnosis and for possible treatment options (usually after delivery).","title" : "an achy, swollen pelvis"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 378,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my skin is breaking out the way it did when i was in middle school-not cute.\" the glow of pregnancy that some women are lucky enough to radiate isn\'t just a result of joy, but of the stepped-up secretion of oils brought on by hormonal changes. and so, alas, are the less-than-glowing breakouts of pregnancy that some not-so-lucky expectant mamas experience (particularly those who break out like clockwork before their periods). though such eruptions are hard to eliminate entirely, the following suggestions may help keep them at a minimum-and keep you from resembling your 8th-grade yearbook picture: ? wash your face 2 or 3 times a day with a gentle cleanser. but don\'t get overaggressive with scrubs-not only because your skin is extra sensitive during pregnancy, but because over-stripped skin is actually more susceptible to breakouts. ? get the all clear on any acne medica- tions (topical or oral) before you use them (see page 151). ? use an oil-free moisturizer to keep skin hydrated. skin that\'s dried out by harsh acne cleansers and treatments can become more pimple prone. metics that are oil-free and labeled \"non-comedogenic,\" which means they won\'t clog pores. ? keep everything that touches your face clean, including those blush brushes at the bottom of your makeup bag. ? pop (and pick) not. just like your mother always told you, popping or picking at pimples won\'t make them go away-and can actually make them stick around longer by pushing bacteria back down into the zit. plus, when you\'re pregnant, you\'re more prone to infections. poked-at pimples can also leave scars. ? feed your face well. a diet that\'s low in sugar, loaded with fruits and veggies, and favors whole grains and healthy fats (think the pregnancy diet) may help minimize those hormonal breakout performances. ? got bacne that just won\'t back off? besides being faithful to cleanliness and healthy eating habits, ask your practitioner or a dermatologist who knows you\'re expecting about pregnancy-safe creams that might work (most practitioners give the okay to azelaic acid). the doc might also suggest you wash your back (or chest if that\'s where the pimples are popping up) with a glycolic or fruit-acid-based cleanser to help clear those angry red bumps.","title" : "breakouts"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 379,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my skin is really dry. is that pregnancy related, too?\" f eeling a tad reptilian these days? you can blame your hormones for your dry, often itchy, skin. hormonal changes can sometimes rob your skin of oil and elasticity, giving it that not-so-lovely mama alligator look. to keep your skin as soft as your baby-to-be\'s bottom: ? switch to a nonsoap cleanser such as cetaphil or aquanil, and use it no more than once a day (at night if you\'re taking off makeup). wash with just water the rest of the time. ? slather on moisturizer while your skin is still damp (after a bath or shower), and use the moisturizer as often as you can-and definitely before you turn in for the night. ? cut down on bathing and keep your showers short. too much washing can dry out your skin. make sure, too, that the water is lukewarm and not hot. hot water removes natural oil from the skin, making it dry and itchy. ? add unscented bath oils to your tub, but be careful with the slippery surface you\'ve created. (remember, as your belly grows, so will your klutz factor.) ? drink plenty of fluids throughout the day to stay hydrated, and be sure to include good fats in your diet (those omega-3s that are so baby friendly are also skin friendly). ? keep your home well humidified. ? wear a sunscreen with an spf of at least 15 (preferably 30) every day.","title" : "dry skin"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 380,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'ve always been prone to eczema, but now that i\'m pregnant, it\'s gotten much worse. what can i do?\" unfortunately, pregnancy (or more accurately, its hormones) often exacerbates the symptoms of eczema, and for women who suffer from this skin condition, the itching and scaling can become practically unbearable. (some lucky eczema sufferers find that pregnancy actually causes the eczema to go into remission.) fortunately, low-dose hydrocortisone creams and ointments are safe to use during pregnancy in moderate amounts-ask your practitioner or dermatologist for a recommendation. antihistamines may also be helpful in coping with the itchiness, but again, be sure to check with your practitioner first. most other options are off the table now that you\'re expecting. for instance, cyclosporine, long used on severe cases of eczema that don\'t respond to other treatment, is generally not prescribed during pregnancy. nonsteroidals protopic and elidel aren\'t recommended either, because they haven\'t been studied in pregnancy and can\'t be ruled safe until more is known. finally, some topical and systemic antibiotics may be shelved during pregnancy, so get your practitioner\'s clearance on those, too, before using. if you\'re an eczema sufferer, you know that prevention can go a long way in keeping the itch away. try the following: ? use a cold compress-not your fin- gernails-to curb the itch. scratching makes the condition worse and can puncture the skin, allowing bacteria to enter and cause an infection. keep nails short and rounded to decrease the chance that you\'ll puncture your skin when you do scratch. ? limit contact with potential irritants such as household cleaners, soaps, perfumes, and fruit juices. wear gloves to protect your hands when cooking and cleaning. ? moisturize early and often (while skin is still damp, if you\'re just out of the water) to lock in the skin\'s own moisture. ? limit time in the water (especially very warm water). course that\'s easier said than done when you\'re pregnant and already one hot, sweaty mama. stay cool by wearing loose cotton clothes and avoiding synthetic fabrics, wool, or any scratchy material. avoid overheating by favoring that layered look- and peeling off layers as you start to warm up. ? try to keep your cool, too, when it comes to stress-a common eczema trigger. when you feel anxiety creeping in, take some relaxation breaths (see page 148). ? seek alternatives. acupuncture may work to decrease nerve pain and moderate the itch, and it also helps relieve stress. ? do a diet check. if you\'re allergic to a certain food (or suspect you are), cut it out to see if that helps curb your eczema. though diet seems to have less effect on eczema than internet legend would have you believe, it\'s worth asking your dermatologist whether a change in what you\'re eating might help. ask, too, about adding probiot-ics to your diet. while studies haven\'t yet shown that probiotics help ease a the chances that your baby-to-be will develop eczema later on. vitamin d supplementation, though still a bit controversial, has shown some promise as a treatment for eczema, but check with your practitioner first. something to keep in mind: though eczema is hereditary (meaning that your baby has a chance of having it, too), research suggests that breastfeed-ing may prevent eczema from developing in a child. that\'s just one more good reason to opt for breastfeeding if you can.","title" : "eczema"}},"add"

preventing needless complications. though routine office visits sometime seem a waste of time in a healthy pregnancy (\"i have to pee in a cup again?\"), that\'s when the earliest signs of preeclampsia are usually picked up. early symptoms of preeclampsia include a rise in blood pressure, protein in the urine, severe swelling of the hands and face, persistent severe headaches, pain in

: {"id" : 386,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'ve seen a lot of ads about cord blood banking. is that something i should be considering?\" a s if you don\'t have enough to think about before baby\'s born, here\'s something else to consider: should you save your baby\'s umbilical cord blood- and if so, how? cord blood harvesting is a simple, painless procedure that takes less than 5 minutes and is performed after the cord has been clamped and cut. it\'s completely safe for both mom and baby (as long as the cord is not clamped and cut prematurely). why collect and store cord blood, instead of tossing it as is usually done? because a newborn\'s cord blood contains many types of stem cells (including cells with the incredible capacity to turn into any other kind of blood and immune system cells) that can, in some cases, be used to treat certain immune system disorders or blood diseases. the stem cells in cord blood are already considered a standard treatment for a variety of diseases, including leukemias (cancers of the blood immune system), bone marrow cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastoma; inherited red-blood-cell abnormalities such as sickle cell disease and anemias; gaucher disease and hurler syndrome; and inherited immune system and immune-cell disorders. what\'s more, cord blood stem cells are also being investigated as possible treatments for other conditions and diseases, ranging from diabetes and cerebral palsy to autism and certain heart defects present at birth. there are two ways to store the blood: you can pay for private storage or you can donate the blood to a public storage bank. private storage can be expensive-costing a couple of thousand dollars or more for the collection of the blood, plus yearly maintenance fees (plus the fee for the doctor and hospital if they offer cord blood collection). some private banks offer free or discounted banking if there is a family medical need (such as a family member who\'s in need of a transplant) or a family history of a condition that qualifies them to participate in a trial (autism, for instance). discounts are also often given for military families and those of first responders. and you can check whether your health insurance company offers discounts or partial reimbursement for private banking. the benefits of private cord blood banking, if your family has no history of immune disorders currently being treated with cord blood stem cells, isn\'t completely clear. also not clear is how many years the frozen units will remain viable (different companies make different claims about their storage equipment). if you can afford the price of private banking, there\'s no downside- though realistically, it\'s very unlikely that your baby or another family member will ever end up with a condition that can be treated with the stored cells. what are the official recommendations? acog doesn\'t take a stand, but recommends that doctors present parents with the pros and cons of both private and public banking. the american academy of pediatrics (aap) doesn\'t recommend private cord blood storage unless a family member has a medical condition that might be helped by a stem cell transplant now or in the near future. the aap does, however, support parents donating the cord blood to a bank for general use by the public. as of now, studies show that the likelihood that a child will ever tap into his or her own saved cord blood later is very low (1 in 2,700 to 1 in 20,000 by some estimates). in fact, experts point out that a baby\'s own cord blood cells are often unsuitable for treating a condition that shows up later in the child\'s life (like leukemia), because the mutations ultimately responsible for the condition are present at birth, and can be found in those cells. what about treating an adult family member with the stored cells later on? the likelihood of that is also low, since most stored units of cord blood don\'t contain enough stem cells to treat anyone weighing more than 90 pounds. the chances are somewhat higher that you\'d be able to use the stored cord blood to help treat a young sibling who has or develops a certain disease. public banking is open to any family (as long as the hospital where you\'re delivering offers it). the upside is that it\'s free and could ultimately save a life (including your own child\'s, since the more cord blood donations there are, the higher the chances that you\'ll be able to find a suitable match if your child should need one). in fact, the odds of finding a suitably matched, publicly donated, unrelated cord blood unit are already quite high and continue to improve as inventories of public cord blood banks grow (a good reason to think about donating your baby\'s).","title"

ready to go before those contractions strike. finally, be sure you understand how cord blood collecting may impact your birth. for instance, if you\'re planning a water birth you\'ll need to leave the water when birthing the placenta to minimize the unnecessary loss of cord blood. be sure, too, to notify the company you\'re storing the cord blood with that you\'re having a home birth in case there are any special storage and shipping instructions you\'ll need to know about. the downside is that you can\'t access your own child\'s cord blood cells once they\'re donated. one thing is for sure: there\'s no benefit to letting your baby\'s cord blood get tossed. to make sure that those precious blood cells don\'t go to waste (or into the medical waste bin), talk about the options available to

is in on your plan and ready to implement it. \"i\'m considering storing my baby\'s umbilical cord blood in a private bank-but i\'m not sure how to go about doing it.\" the first step is to partner up with your practitioner on your plan. not only so you can get your practitioner\'s take on cord blood banking, but also so you can make sure he or she is willing and able to collect the cord blood. it\'s rare that a doctor or midwife couldn\'t (or wouldn\'t) perform this simple and quick procedure, but a fee may be involved. then it\'s time to hit the books- or at least the internet-to do your research, so you can find the right cord blood bank for you. any bank you\'re considering should be accredited with the american association of blood banks (aabb). once you\'ve narrowed your choices, it\'s worth calling each one to find out more about their services. you\'ll want the bank\'s representative to explain key things: how the bank collects and stores the blood (there are different collection and storage methods, and you\'ll want to make sure the bank complies with federal standards), how viable the bank\'s cord blood samples are compared with other banks (you\'ll want to choose a bank that has demonstrated good odds of getting a usable blood sample), how stable the company is (you don\'t want the bank to go out of business, so explore the pros and cons of choosing a lesser-known, smaller bank versus a larger, well-known bank that has been operating for longer), and what they actually store (some banks store only cord blood, while others store the blood and cord tissue from around the blood vessels in the cord that contain different types of stem cells). once you\'ve made your pick, it\'s time to enroll with your bank of choice. aim to sign up by the end of your second trimester-or at least before week 34. once you sign up, the cord blood bank will mail you a collection kit so that you\'ll have it on hand for the big day. the kit will probably have a medical form for you to fill out, plus sealed medical supplies your practitioner will use to collect the cord blood. fill out the form, sign it, and put it back in the kit (but leave the kit\'s medical supplies sealed). pack the kit away in your hospital bag so you won\'t have to scramble to find it when those contractions hit. once you\'re in labor, it\'s time to give the cord blood kit to your practitioner (or the staff). this will remind him or her about your cord blood banking decision, and it will alert the medical staff that they\'ll need to collect a blood sample from you before delivery (the kit comes with the materials your practitioner will need to collect and send in your blood). right after you deliver (whether it\'s a vaginal or cesarean delivery), your practitioner will clamp the umbilical cord (he or she can and should wait until the cord stops pulsating to allow for delayed cord clamping) and collect the cord blood with the supplies provided in your kit. your partner can still cut the cord, because that doesn\'t affect the collection process. when the collection is complete, it\'s time for you (or more likely your partner, since you\'ll be a bit distracted) or your practitioner (or staff) to call the bank. once the call is made, the bank will arrange for a courier to pick up the cord blood kit and send it off to the laboratory for storage. the kit will arrive at the lab no later than 36 hours after you deliver your precious bundle. the bank will contact you to let you know that your cord blood arrived safely and to tell you how much they were able to collect and process. they will also, of course, send you a yearly bill for storage fees. keep in mind that you may not be able to collect and store enough of your baby\'s cord blood if he or she is born preterm (even if you\'ve planned for it) or if your twins share a placenta (though check with your chosen bank for guidelines to be certain). you may also find cord blood banking a struggle to arrange if you are based overseas but would like to bank or donate your baby\'s blood in the u.s. \"i\'d like to donate my baby\'s cord blood to a public bank. what\'s the best way to do that?\" f irst, know that the decision you\'ve made might save a life someday. cord blood contains stem cells that can treat a host of diseases, and most major medical organizations (including the aap) encourage public donation of umbilical-cord blood cells so they can be used for actual transplants or for valuable medical research-a far better option than letting that precious cord blood be

have an std, hepatitis, or cancer) and start making the arrangements necessary to bank publicly. you may also want to find out whether your practitioner charges a fee for collecting the cord blood, even if it\'s being donated to a public bank that accepts all donations free of charge. donating your baby\'s cord blood will be easiest if you\'ll be delivering at a hospital that participates in the national cord blood donation program run through the national marrow donor program (to check if your hospital does, go to marrow.org/cord). if your hospital doesn\'t participate, find out if there\'s a public bank nearby that will accept your donation, or one that will allow mail-in donations, by visiting parentsguidecordblood.org. be sure to register with your bank of choice before week 34, since you won\'t be able to arrange this at the last minute (say, when you\'re about to start pushing). remember to keep your practitioner in the loop about the plans you make for your baby\'s cord blood. the cord blood bank will ask for your medical history, a blood sample (which will be taken right before you deliver), and a signed consent form. the bank may send you a collection kit to bring to the hospital, or may work directly with your practitioner or the hospital for the collection. (just double-check to see if this is the case if you don\'t receive a kit.) if you\'re working with a public cord blood bank that\'s not affiliated with your hospital or birthing center, your partner may have to call the bank once you\'re in labor to arrange for a courier to pick up the cord blood. depending on the public bank you use, you may be able to keep track of your donation and find out if it was accepted and stored.","title" : "home birth and cord blood banking"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 388,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'m eager to become a mother, but not so eager to experience childbirth. mostly, i worry about the pain.\" a lmost every expectant mom eagerly awaits the birth of her child, but few look forward to labor and delivery-and far fewer still to the pain of labor and delivery. and many, like you, spend a fair amount of time in the months leading up to this momentous event worrying about the pain. that\'s not surprising. the fear of labor pain-which is, after all, an unknown quantity of pain-is very real and very understandable. but it\'s important to keep in mind the following: childbirth is a normal life process, which women have been experiencing as long as there have been women. sure, it comes with pain, but it\'s a pain with a positive purpose (though it won\'t necessarily feel positive when you\'re in it): to thin and open your cervix, and bring your baby into your arms. and it\'s also a pain with a built-in time limit. you might not believe it (especially somewhere around the 5-cm mark), but labor won\'t last forever. not only that, but the pain of childbirth is optional (no pain, no gain doesn\'t apply to labor and delivery). an epidural or another form of pain relief is always just a request away, should you end up wanting it or needing it-or both. and if you\'re sure you\'ll want and need it, you can even sign up for that epidural ahead of time and get it as early in labor as you like-at least, once you arrive at the hospital. so there\'s no point in dreading the pain, but there\'s a lot to be said for being prepared for it. preparing now (both your body and mind-since both are involved in how you experience pain) should help reduce the anxiety you\'re feeling now and the amount of discomfort (okay, pain) you\'ll feel once those contractions kick in. get educated. a good childbirth education class can ease your anxiety (and ultimately pain) by increasing knowledge, preparing you and your coach, stage by stage and phase by phase, for labor and delivery. if you can\'t take a class or if you just don\'t want to, read up on childbirth as much as you can. what you don\'t know can worry you more than it has to. taking classes makes sense, by the way, even if you\'re planning to have an epidural-or even if you have a cesarean delivery scheduled. just make sure that the curriculum in the class you choose covers all the birthing bases. get moving. you wouldn\'t consider running a marathon without the proper physical training-and you shouldn\'t consider heading into labor untrained, either. work out with all the breathing, stretching, and toning-up exercises your practitioner and/or childbirth educator recommends, plus plenty of kegels. team up. whether you have your partner there to comfort you and feed you ice chips, a doula (see page 328) to massage your back, or a friend to wipe your brow-or if you really like company, all three-a little support can go a long way in easing your fears. even if you don\'t end up feeling very chatty during labor, it will be comforting to know that you\'re not going it alone. and make sure your coach is trained, too-not only by taking classes with you, but by reading the section on labor and delivery beginning on page 418. have a pain plan-and a backup plan. maybe you\'ve already decided that an epidural has your name on it. maybe you\'re hoping to breathe your way through those contractions-or use hypnobirthing for pain management. maybe you\'re waiting to make that decision until you see how much pain you\'re facing. either way, think ahead, and then keep your mind open (because labor has a way of not always following plans). see page 330 for more on pain relief.","title" : "childbirth pain"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 389,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'m afraid i\'ll

and how do you choose? in some communities, where childbirth class options are limited, the choice of which class to take is a relatively simple one. in others, the variety of offerings can be overwhelming and confusing. courses are run by hospitals, by private instructors, by practitioners through their offices. there are \"early bird\" prenatal classes, taken in the first or second trimester, which cover all things pregnancy: nutrition, exercise, fetal development, and sex. and there are down-to-the-wire 6- to 10-week childbirth preparation classes, usually beginning in the 7th or 8th month, which concentrate on labor, delivery, and postpartum mother and baby care. there are even weekend getaway classes. no time for an in-person course?

a class that is run by or recommended by your practitioner often works out best. also useful could be a class provided by the hospital or birthing center where you\'ll be delivering. if the laboring and delivering philosophy of your childbirth education teacher varies a lot from that of your birth attendants, you\'re bound to run into contradictions and conflicts. if differences of opinion do come up, make sure you address them with your practitioner well before your delivery date. what\'s the size of the class? small is best. five or six moms-to-be and their coaches per class is ideal-more than 10 or 12 may be too large. not only can a teacher provide extra time and individual attention in an intimate group-particularly important during the breathing and relaxation technique practice sessions-but the camaraderie in a small group tends to be stronger. what\'s the curriculum like? whichever type of class you choose, you can expect to learn about the stages of a normal labor and delivery as well as possible complications and how they might be handled. a comprehensive class should also cover postpartum care, basic newborn care, and breastfeeding. most classes will enlighten you about birth plans, doulas, hospital births versus delivering in a birthing center or at home, and medical interventions (such as a c-section or induction) that could (but probably won\'t) be necessary. be sure to find out, too, if the course covers natural ways to reduce or cope with pain (such as massage, acupressure, aromatherapy, or using a birthing ball) as well as provides an overview of pain-relief options. how is the class taught?

(exercise! sex! travel! all of them in one weekend!). but by the third trimester, many moms-to-be find themselves once again dragging-and eyeing the sofa longingly. and that\'s not surprising. though some women continue to sprint as they close in on the pregnancy finish line (remember, every pregnancy is different, even when it comes to energy levels), there are lots more good reasons why you might be lagging behind. the best reason can be found around your midsection. after all, you\'re carrying much more weight there (and other places) than you were earlier on-and carting those extra pounds can be exhausting. another reason: these days, that extra bulk may be lying (literally) between you and a good night\'s sleep, leaving you less rested each morning. your baby-overloaded mind (jam-packed with shopping lists, to-do lists, baby-name lists, questions-to-ask-the-doctor lists, decisions to be made) may also be costing you z\'s-and energy. add other, unrelated life responsibilities to the mix-a job, the care and feeding of other children, and so on-and the fatigue factors multiply exponentially. as always, fatigue is a signal from your body, so pay attention. if you\'ve been living life in the maternity fast lane (too much baby prep, not enough rest), slow down the pace a bit. cut back on nonessential essentials in your day (no fair calling them all essentials). get your exercise high but take the intensity down a notch, and time it so it\'s not too close to bedtime (when it can mess with sleep). and since running on empty can bench you in a hurry, fuel your energy levels with frequent healthy snacks. most of all, remember that f o r f a t h e r s","title" : ""}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 407,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "i f you think you\'re tired at the end of the day, think about this: your baby mama expends more energy lying on the sofa building a baby than you do bodybuilding at the gym. which makes her a lot more tired than you\'ve ever known her to be-and a lot more tired than you can even imagine. so pick up the slack. and your slacks. and the trail of socks and sneakers in the hallway. beat her to the vacuuming and the laundry and the toilet cleaning-the fumes from the cleaning products will make her feel sicker anyway. encourage her to watch your cleanup routine from a fully reclining position on the sofa- even if that\'s always been your favorite position. third-trimester fatigue is nature\'s way of telling mamas-to-be to conserve energy. you\'ll need every bit of strength you can save up now for labor, delivery, and (of course) what follows. for more energy-saving tips, revisit the ones on page 130. if you do get the extra rest your body is calling for but still feel consistently run-down, talk to your practitioner. sometimes, extreme fatigue that doesn\'t ease up is triggered by third-trimester anemia (see page 251), which is why most practitioners repeat a routine blood test to check iron stores in the 7th month.","title" : "picking up the slack(s)"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 408,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my ankles and feet are puffy, especially at the end of the day. is that supposed to happen?\" your belly\'s not the only thing that\'s swelling these days. that puff mama look often extends to the extremities, too. and although all that swelling\'s not so swell-especially as your shoes and watch get uncomfortably tight and your rings become harder and harder to pry off your fingers-mild swelling (aka edema) of the ankles, feet, and hands is completely normal, related to the necessary increase in body fluids in pregnancy. in fact, 75 percent of women develop swelling at some point in their pregnancies, usually around this point (the other 25 percent never notice any at all, which is normal, too). as you\'ve probably already noticed, the puffiness is likely to be more pronounced late in the day, in warm weather, or after spending too much time sitting or standing. in fact, you may find that much of the swelling disappears overnight or after several hours spent lying down (another good reason to get that rest). generally, this type of swelling means nothing more than a little discomfort-and a few fashion compromises if you can no longer squeeze your ankles into those super cute boots or strappy sandals. still, you\'ll want to find ways to deflate, if you can. to spell swell relief, keep these tips in mind: ? stay off your feet and off your butt. if long periods of standing or sitting are part of your job description-at home or at the office-take periodic breaks. have a seat if you\'ve been standing, and get up if you\'ve been sitting. or for best results, take a brisk 5-minute walk to rev up your circulation (which should get those pooled fluids flowing). ? put \'em up. elevate your legs when you\'re sitting. if anyone deserves to put her feet up, it\'s you. ? get some rest on your side. if you\'re not already in the side-lying habit, it\'s time to try it now. lying on your side helps keep your kidneys working at peak efficiency, enhancing waste elimination and reducing swelling.","title" : "swelling"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 409,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "have your rings been getting snugger and snugger?

move it. keeping up your practitioner- approved workouts will keep down the swelling. walking (you\'ll probably soon call it waddling) is swell for swollen feet since it\'ll keep blood flowing instead of pooling. swimming or water aerobics are even better, because the water pressure pushes tissue fluid back into your veins. from there it goes into your kidneys, after which you\'ll pee it out. ? salt to taste. it was once believed that salt restriction would help keep the swelling down, but it is now known that limiting salt too much increases swelling. just make moderation your motto. ? get the support you need. you may not think \"sexy\" when you think maternity support hose, but they\'ve come a long way in style and innovation-and most important, they\'re very effective in relieving swelling. comfortable compression comes in basic full panty hose, knee highs and thigh highs (just avoid ones with tight elastic tops), and even fashion-forward tights and footless/legging varieties. when possible, opt for cotton blends for breathability. putting compression hose on first thing in the morning, before the day\'s swelling begins, can keep those fluids from pooling in the first place. the good news about edema, besides that it\'s normal, is that it\'s temporary. you can look forward to your ankles deflating and your fingers depuffing soon after you give birth (though some moms find it can take up to a month or more for swelling to time, look on the bright side: soon your belly will be so big, you won\'t be able to see how swollen your feet are. if the swelling seems to be more than mild, let your practitioner know. severe swelling can be one of the symptoms of preeclampsia, but it isn\'t considered a reliable one (since pregnancy swelling is common and varies so much from mom to mom). so unless severe swelling is accompanied by protein in the urine and elevated blood pressure (both are screened for at each prenatal appointment), or by other symptoms of preeclampsia (which may include severe headaches, vision disturbances, and increasing shortness of breath), it\'s likely just a normal part of the pregnancy package. still, when in doubt, get it checked out.","title" : "take them off, while you can"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 410,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"as if it\'s not bad enough that i have stretch marks, now i seem to have some kind of itchy bumps breaking out in them.\" cheer up. you have less than 3 months left until delivery, when you\'ll be able to bid a grateful good-bye to most of the unpleasant side effects of pregnancy-among them, these late-breaking-out bumps. until then, it may help to know that although they may be uncomfortable (and slightly unsightly), the bumps aren\'t concerning. known medically-and unpronounceably-as pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (try saying that fast 3 times), aka puppp, or pep (polymorphic eruption of pregnancy), the condition generally disappears after delivery and doesn\'t recur in subsequent pregnancies. though puppp most often develops in abdominal stretch marks, it sometimes also appears on the thighs, show your rash to your practitioner, who may prescribe topical medication, an antihistamine, or a shot to ease any discomfort. a variety of other skin conditions and rashes can develop during pregnancy (lucky you!), making you less than happy with the skin you\'re in. though you should always show any rash that crops up to your practitioner, keep in mind that rashes are rarely cause for concern. see page 258 for more.","title" : "strange skin bumps"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 411,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'ve been having pain on the side of my lower back, running right down my hip and leg. what\'s that about?\" sounds like your sweet little baby may be getting on your nerves- your sciatic nerve, that is. toward the middle to end of your pregnancy, your baby begins to settle into the proper position for birth (a big positive). in doing that, however, his or her head- and the weight of your ever-enlarging uterus-may settle on the sciatic nerve in the lower part of your spine (a big negative). such so-called sciatica can less frequently be caused by a herniated or slipped disk (also due to the extra pressure of that growing uterus). either way, sciatica can result in sharp, shooting, sometimes intense pain, tingling or numbness that starts in your buttocks or lower back and radiates down the back of either of your legs. though sciatica may pass if your baby shifts positions, it can also linger until you\'ve delivered-and sometimes even linger a little postpartum. how can you get baby off your nerves and relieve the pain of sciatica? try these tips: ease the pain (but avoid sitting on the floor, which can intensify pain). lying down on the side that doesn\'t hurt can also relieve pressure-and it\'s smart to sleep on that side, too. ? get support. a belly band or other support garment can take the pressure of your growing uterus off your lower back and hips. ? warm it. a warm heating pad applied on the spot where you feel the pain can help ease it, as can a long soak in a warm bath. have jets in your tub?

seek an alternative. ask your prac- titioner about cam therapies that might help ease sciatic pain, such as physical therapy, therapeutic massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic medicine. it\'s a good idea to check in with your practitioner if you\'re having symptoms of sciatic pain, not only for suggested therapies and treatments (including medication, if needed), but for a proper diagnosis. another condition with similar symptoms (pelvic girdle pain, or pgp) is sometimes misdiagnosed as sciatica. see page 561 for more.","title" : "lower back and leg pain (sciatica)"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 412,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"once in a while i get this sudden sharp pain deep inside my crotch-almost like i\'m being stabbed down there. it doesn\'t last long but it\'s so intense it takes my breath away. what is it?\" sounds like you\'ve been struck by lightning crotch-a surprisingly common, yet little discussed, symptom of late pregnancy that can be a real pain. this sensation can be felt deep in the pelvis or vagina-sometimes like an electric shock, sometimes like a sharp jabbing, sometimes with a little stinging and burning or pins and needles added in. it typically comes on suddenly and unexpectedly and with such intensity that it can nearly knock you off your feet (and have you shrieking out loud in public). there\'s no definitive medical evidence that pinpoints why lightning crotch happens-there isn\'t even a medical term for it-but there are plenty of theories on what triggers that punched-in-the-pants feeling. some experts say it happens when baby presses on or kicks a nerve that runs to the cervix. others suggest that your little one might be using your sensitive cervix and lower uterus as a punching bag or that your baby-on-the-move is pushing down as he or she changes positions. or that the very normal stretching and pulling of the ligaments surrounding and supporting your uterus as your belly grows (and grows) is switching on those electric-like shocks in your pelvis. one thing that is clear is that lightning crotch is not a result of cervical dilation, which means if you\'re feeling that telltale stabbing feeling down below, there\'s no","title" : "lightning crotch"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 413,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "f rom the 28th week on, it may be a good idea to test for fetal movements twice a day-once in the morning, when activity tends to be quieter, and once in the more active evening hours. your practitioner may recommend a test, or you can use this one: note the time on the clock and start counting. count movements of any kind (kicks, flutters, swishes, rolls), but don\'t include hiccups in your tally. stop counting when you reach 10, and note the time.

though there are no sure bets, it may pay to try any of the following: ? keep track of triggers. it\'s possible that diet and other lifestyle habits may contribute to rls, so it may help to keep a journal of what you eat, what you do, and how you feel each day so you can see what habits, if any, bring on symptoms. some women, for instance, find that eating carbohydrates late in the day can set off restless legs, and others find that caffeine can pull the trigger. look at the meds you take, too, to see if there might be a connection to your rls. ? turn to cam. acupuncture may help turn off rls, as may yoga, meditation, or other relaxation techniques. even distraction (doing something to take your mind off the discomfort) may help ease that restless feeling. ? check your levels. iron-deficiency anemia (common in the third trimester anyway) sometimes triggers rls, so ask your practitioner about getting your levels tested. if your stores do turn out to be low, taking the right iron supplement can relieve the symptoms. other possible triggers of rls that a blood test can reveal: a deficiency in magnesium or vitamin d, either of which can be treated with a supplement. while you\'re at it, ask your practitioner about other suggested treatments. getting those legs moving during the day can keep them from wanting to move all night. try pregnancy-safe moderate cardio exercise and lower-body strength training, but not too close to bedtime (since that can exacerbate rls, plus keep you from sleeping, period). simple stretches may also work-try calf stretches or a standing leg stretch (see page 292). ? try these at home. applying hot or cold packs to your legs or even taking a cold shower (or soaking your legs in cold water) before bed may ward off that restless feeling. you can also try wearing compression socks or stockings during the day. and, of course, it couldn\'t hurt to try the sleep tips on page 284. in fact, because fatigue can worsen rls symptoms, do what you can to get the sleep your body is craving. hopefully, you\'ll find at least some relief from rls in the strategies listed here. unfortunately, some moms-to-be with rls find that nothing works for them and their only option is waiting it out until delivery brings relief (if not a good night\'s sleep-after all, a new baby rarely brings that). if you came into pregnancy with the condition, you\'ll probably have to wait until after delivery (and possibly after weaning, if you\'re nursing) to resume any drug treatment you were using.","title" : "restless leg syndrome"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 415,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i sometimes feel regular little spasms in my abdomen. is this kicking, or a twitch, or what?\" b elieve it or not, your baby\'s prob-ably got hiccups. many fetuses have bouts of hiccups in the last half of pregnancy, with some getting them every day, even several times a day. others never seem to get them at all. the same pattern may continue after birth. but before you start holding your breath or trying other hiccup tricks, you should know that hiccups don\'t cause discomfort in babies-in or out of the uterus-even when they last 20 minutes or more. so just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. as entertaining as they are, though, keep in mind that fetal hiccups don\'t count when you\'re doing your kick counts (see page 336).","title" : "fetal hiccups"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 416,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "so, you were definitely expect-ing to see your baby\'s movements-but hear them?

just-for-fun ultrasounds (though definitely fun) are often done using higher powered machines that are not necessarily operated or maintained by skilled staff. some of the sessions last a much longer time than a medical scan would-up to 45 minutes-which means more (unnecessary) ultrasound exposure. sign up for multiple sessions to build a prenatal scrapbook of images and videos, as many centers offer, and baby\'s exposure is exponentially increased. another concern experts have: without a skilled medical professional to perform the scan and interpret the results, parents-to-be may walk away convinced there\'s something wrong with their baby, or worse, that the less-trained wand wavers will miss real problems that a pro would detect. plus, a long session or repeated sessions can be intrusive and disruptive for a fetus, who\'s using womb time to grow, develop, and get the sleep he or she needs-free of interruptions. finally, while there are no proven risks to extra ultrasound exams, there\'s no definitive proof that risks don\'t exist- potential risks that can be avoided by skipping unnecessary scans. remember, there will be plenty of opportunities to take photos and videos, and make memories when your baby is born. in the meantime, think about keeping ultrasounds to the number and type prescribed by your practitioner (currently, acog recommends a total of 1 to 2 in low-risk, complication-free pregnancies). have your practitioner\'s clearance and an appointment scheduled?

possibly not as much as you\'d hope- about 12 ounces of brewed coffee (2 small cups or 1 \"tall\") or about 2 shots of espresso. which means you\'re good to go-and fuel your get-up-and-go-if you\'re a light to moderate coffee drinker. but you\'ll have to reassess your intake if you\'ve got a more serious java jones (for instance, you\'re a member in good standing of the 5-shot americano club). why go so low? well, for one thing, you share that coffee-like everything you eat and drink when you\'re expecting-with your baby. caffeine (found most famously, abundantly, and arguably deliciously in coffee but also available in other foods and beverages) does cross the placenta-though to what extent (and at what dose) it affects a fetus is not completely clear. the latest information indicates that heavier caffeine intake early in pregnancy slightly increases the risk of miscarriage. but there\'s more to the caffeine story, at least when you overdo the stuff. sure, caffeine has impressive pick-me-up powers, but in large doses it can block the absorption of iron. it can also act as a diuretic, causing calcium and other key pregnancy nutrients to be washed out of your system before they can be thoroughly absorbed-not to mention, increasing urinary frequency (something you\'ve likely found is plenty frequent enough). it can be irritating to your bladder, too, which is already under plenty of pressure (literally) during pregnancy. need more motivation for cutting down? too much caffeine mixed with pregnancy hormones can make an especially intense brew for many expectant moms-the perfect storm for even more volatile mood swings. it can also prevent you from getting the rest your body\'s craving more than ever, especially if you drink it after noon (caffeine can stay in your system, keeping your engine revved, for at least 8 hours). different practitioners have different recommendations on caffeine consumption, so check in with yours for a bottom line on your coffee quota. when calculating your daily intake, keep in mind that it\'s not necessarily as easy as counting cups (especially because those cups vary so much in size and strength). caffeine isn\'t found just in coffee-it\'s also in caffeinated soft drinks (too many mountain dews are a mountain don\'t), coffee ice cream and yogurt, many varieties of tea, energy bars and drinks, and chocolate (the darker the chocolate, the more caffeine it packs). you\'ll need to know, too, that dark brews poured at coffee bars contain far more caffeine than homemade. likewise, instant coffee contains less than drip does (see box, page 64). how do you cut down on a hefty caffeine habit (or cut it out altogether if you choose)? that depends on what\'s in the caffeine for you. if it\'s a part of your day (or many parts of your day) you\'re not excited about parting with, there\'s no need to. just make your morning joe regular and your afternoons decaf. or order your latte with mostly decaf shots instead of regular-or with less espresso and more milk (you\'ll get a bigger calcium bonus anyway). if it\'s the lift you crave-and that your body has become accustomed to-cutting back will be a taller order (make that a venti order). as any coffee lover is well aware, it\'s one thing to be motivated to cut back on or kick caffeine altogether and another thing to do it. caffeine is addictive (that\'s where the craving comes in), and quitting- or even cutting way back on-a heavy habit comes with its own set of withdrawal symptoms, including headache, irritability, fatigue, and lethargy. that\'s why it\'s a good idea to ease off heavy consumption gradually. try cutting back a cup at a time, and give yourself a few days to adjust to the lower dose before cutting back by another cup. another way to cut back: take each cup half-caf, gradually going full decaf in more and more cups-until your total caffeine consumption is down to that two-a-day-or-less goal. no matter what\'s been driving you to the coffee bar, cutting back on or kicking caffeine will be less of a drag if you follow these energizing solutions: ? boost your blood sugar to boost your energy. you\'ll get a longer-lasting boost from snacking on healthy foods often, especially complex carbs and protein (a combo that will give you the lift that keeps on lifting). ? get some pregnancy-appropriate exercise each day. working out will help you work out those caffeine cravings, but it\'ll also raise the energy roof while releasing those feel-good endorphins. adding fresh air to the exercise mix will give you an extra energy boost. ? get your buzz from z\'s. clocking in the sleep your body needs at night (which will probably be easier to do without all that caffeine keeping you wired) will help you feel more refreshed in the morning, even before you\'ve filled your first mug. ?

with dinner when you\'re pregnant. is that true?\" i t\'s been passed around the pregnancy grapevine a lot lately, but there\'s no research to support that an occasional glass of wine (or beer, or cocktail) is a safe bet when you\'re expecting. in fact, the surgeon general, the cdc, acog, aap, and many other experts advise that no amount of alcohol is safe for pregnant women. you can check in with your practitioner for a recommendation-some practitioners are more lenient when it comes to alcohol in pregnancy (especially that occasional glass of wine, sipped with food), taking a page from medical texts in the u.k. and many european countries, where light drinking for two is considered acceptable. but here\'s why the medical consensus in the u.s comes down so definitively against drinking during pregnancy. first, it\'s to be on the safe side-which, when you think about it, is always the best side to be on when you have a baby on board. though nobody knows for sure whether there is a safe limit when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy (or whether that limit would be different in different women and for different babies), it is known that an expectant mom never drinks alone-she shares each glass of wine, each beer, each cocktail equally with her baby. the alcohol enters the fetal bloodstream in about the same concentrations present in the mom-to-be\'s blood, but it takes the fetus twice as long to eliminate the alcohol from its system. second, for some moms-to-be, having an occasional drink during pregnancy can be a slippery slope- one mom\'s sip of wine may be another mom\'s 12 ounces-making it wiser to just stay away from alcohol altogether. glass sizes and pours (whether at home or in a restaurant) vary widely, too- another good reason to toe the teetotaling line. certainly more than occasional, light drinking is associated with proven, serious risks to a developing baby; see box, page 66. passing up a drink during pregnancy is as easily done as said for some women, especially those who develop an aversion to alcohol in early pregnancy that sometimes lingers through delivery. for others, particularly those who are accustomed to unwinding with a beer at the end of the day or to sipping a glass of red with dinner, abstinence may require a concerted effort and include a lifestyle change. if you drink to relax, for example, try substituting other methods of relaxation: music, a bath, prenatal yoga, or meditation or visualization. if drinking is part of a daily ritual that you don\'t want to give up, try a virgin mary (a bloody mary without the vodka) at brunch, sparkling juice or nonalcoholic beer at dinner, or a half-juice, half-sparkling water spritzer-served at the usual time, in the usual glasses (unless, of course, these look-alike beverages trigger a yen for the real stuff). if your spouse joins you on the wagon (at least while in your company), the ride will be considerably smoother. if you\'re having trouble giving up alcohol, ask your practitioner for help and for a referral to a program that can help you quit.","title" : "drinking"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 430,"author" : "heidi

the 3rd month, isn\'t hazardous to just your health but to your baby\'s as well. in effect, when a mom smokes, her fetus is confined in a smoke-filled womb. its heartbeat speeds up and, worst of all, because of insufficient oxygen, it can\'t grow and thrive as it should. the results can be devastating. smoking around the time of conception increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy and continued

t what point does a drink become one drink too many for a developing fetus? it\'s hard to put a number on that, since every woman and every fetus is different (and the amount of alcohol in different drinks and pours varies). however, drinking heavily throughout pregnancy or binge drinking (having 4 or more drinks at a time, even occasionally) can result not only in serious obstetrical complications, but in fetal alcohol syndrome. this condition produces babies who are born small for gestational age, with facial deformities, and with brain damage (which later shows up as tremors, motor development problems, attention deficits, learning disabilities, lower iq, and possibly other mental deficiencies). but even drinking moderately throughout pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, as well as the risk of developmental and behavioral problems in a child. the effects of drinking during pregnancy are devastating, permanent, and completely preventable by completely avoiding alcohol. the sooner a drinker stops drinking during pregnancy, the less risk there is to her baby and her pregnancy. if you can\'t stop drinking, talk to your practitioner and get

or cleft lip, and heart defects. and being born too small is the major cause of newborn illness and death. there are other potential risks as well. babies of smokers are more likely to die from sids (sudden infant death syndrome). they are also more prone to apnea (breathing lapses), and in general, aren\'t as healthy at birth as babies of nonsmokers. and evidence indicates that, on average, these children will suffer long-term physical and intellectual deficits, especially if parents continue to smoke around them. children of mothers who smoked while pregnant are hospitalized more often in their first year of life, and are particularly prone to a lowered immune system, respiratory diseases, ear infections, colic, tuberculosis, food allergies, asthma, short stature, obesity, and problems in school, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). they\'re also more likely to be abnormally aggressive as toddlers and to have behavioral and psychological problems into adulthood. other research suggests that daughters born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes when they become pregnant later in life. finally, children of moms who smoked during pregnancy are also more likely to grow up to be smokers themselves. the effects of tobacco use, like those of alcohol use, are dose related: tobacco use reduces the birthweight of babies in direct proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked, with a pack-a-day smoker 30 percent more likely to give birth to a low-birthweight child than a nonsmoker. so cutting

do it alone. if there is smoke in her environment, there\'s smoke (and harmful tobacco by-products) in baby\'s. even if she doesn\'t light up herself, but you (or others around her) do, baby\'s body

the benefits to your baby of having a smoke-free dad don\'t end at delivery. smoking by either parent increases the risk of sids in infancy and of respiratory problems, lung damage, and other

can be misleading, because a smoker often compensates by taking more frequent and deeper puffs and smoking more of each cigarette. this can also happen when a smoker switches to low-tar or low-nicotine cigarettes. what about e-cigarettes? despite little research on electronic cigarettes during pregnancy, most experts say it\'s best not to puff on those, either. electronic cigarettes, which claim to have significantly fewer toxins and less nicotine than traditional cigarettes, still contain enough to potentially affect your baby. plus, since they\'re unregulated (meaning anything goes on the label), it\'s hard to know just how much nicotine you\'re exposing yourself (and your baby) to-even from e-cigarettes that are marketed as \"nicotine-free.\" additives and flavorings used in many e-cigarettes may also be questionable when you\'re growing a baby. bottom line: until more is known-and until more regulation is in place-you\'re better off staying away from e-cigarettes. same goes for a hookah, in which the smoke from specially made tobacco passes through water and is then drawn through a rubber hose to a mouthpiece. smoking a hookah is as toxic as smoking a cigarette. despite what you may have heard, the water in the hookah does not filter out the toxic ingredients (like tar, carbon monoxide, and heavy metals) in the tobacco smoke. and what\'s worse, hookah smokers may actually breathe in more nicotine than cigarette smokers do because of the large volume of smoke they inhale during a session. eager to kick the smoking habit? you should be, because some studies show that women who quit smoking early in pregnancy-no later than the 3rd month-can eliminate all of the associated risks. for some smoking women, quitting will never be easier than in early pregnancy, when they might develop a sudden distaste for cigarettes-probably the warning of an intuitive body. sooner is better, but quitting even in the last month can help preserve

but it\'s especially common during pregnancy. while having a baby brings out a new (or renewed) tenderness in many relationships, it rocks others, sometimes triggering unexpectedly negative emotions in a woman\'s partner (from anger to jealousy to a feeling of being trapped), particularly if the pregnancy wasn\'t planned. in some cases, unfortunately, those emotions play out in the form of violence against both the mother and her unborn baby. sometimes, cultural or financial factors, or a family history of domestic violence against women can contribute to a partner\'s aggression, too. the statistics are alarming. nearly 20 percent of all pregnant women experience violence at the hands of their partners, which means that an expectant mother is twice as likely to be the victim of domestic violence as she is to develop preeclampsia or deliver prematurely. more shockingly and tragically still, domestic violence is the single leading cause of death among pregnant women. domestic abuse (emotional, sexual, and physical) against pregnant women carries more than just the immediate risk of injury to the mother-to-be and her baby (such as uterine rupture or hemorrhaging). being battered during pregnancy can lead to numerous negative health consequences, including poor nutrition, poor prenatal care, substance abuse, and so on. its effects on the pregnancy can also include miscarriage or stillbirth, preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and low birthweight. and once a baby is born into a physically abusive household, he or she can easily become a victim of direct violence-as well as emotional abuse. abuse doesn\'t discriminate-it crosses every socioeconomic profile, every religion, every age, every race and ethnicity, and every educational level. if you\'re the victim of domestic violence, remember that it\'s not your fault. you\'ve done nothing wrong. if you are in an abusive relationship, don\'t wait for things to get better-get help now. without intervention, the abuse is likely not only to continue but to get worse. keep in mind that if you\'re not safe in your relationship, your baby won\'t be safe, either. talk to your practitioner, tell your trusted friends and family, and call a local domestic violence hotline. many states have programs that can help you with shelter, clothing, and prenatal care. check out the national coalition against domestic violence at ncadv.org and the cdc\'s domestic violence resource page at cdc.gov/violenceprevention or call the national domestic violence hotline at 800-799-7233 (thehotline.org). if you are in immediate danger, call 911. along with possibly lower iq. certainly, the more a mom-to-be uses cocaine, the greater the risk to her baby. tell your practitioner about any cocaine use since you\'ve conceived. as with every aspect of your medical history, the more he or she knows, the better care you will receive. if you have any difficulty giving up cocaine entirely, seek professional help immediately. not surprisingly, there are serious risks to babies exposed prenatally to other illicit drugs (including heroin, meth, crack, ecstasy, \"ice,\" and pcp). but also potentially dangerous are some prescription drugs that are often abused and that can, with continued use, cause serious harm to a developing fetus and/ or to pregnancy. then, if you are still using drugs, get professional support to help you quit now. enrolling in a drug-free pregnancy program now can make a tremendous difference in the outcome of your pregnancy.","title" : "domestic

the radiation they emit pose any risk to your baby-to-be. eager to play it safe but still keep playing on your phone? experts suggest that you avoid carrying your mobile on your waist (or where your waist once was) and keep it on silent when it\'s near your bump. research shows that fetuses startle when they hear that beeping or buzzing or ringing so close by, possibly rattling their sleep-wake

i have to get rid of my pets?\" b efore you throw the kitties out with the kitty litter, keep in mind that the risk of infection with toxoplasmosis (a parasite that cats and other animals can carry and excrete in their feces and that can be harmful to a baby) is very remote if you have indoor cats. what\'s more, if you\'ve had cats for a while, you\'re likely to already be immune to toxoplasmosis (because you\'ve probably already been infected with it-most cat owners have been). a simple blood test is available that will confirm your immunity, but it won\'t be useful unless you were tested before you conceived (that\'s because the tests are not sensitive enough to show whether you have a new infection or simply have antibodies from an old infection). talk to your practitioner to see if you were tested before you became pregnant. if you were tested before you conceived and were not immune, or if you\'re not sure whether you are immune or not, take the following precautions to avoid infection: ? have your cats tested by the vet to see if they have an active infection. if they do, board them at a kennel or ask a friend to care for them for at least 6 weeks, when the infection is transmissible. if they are free of infection, keep them that way by not allowing them to eat raw meat, roam outdoors, hunt mice or birds (which can transmit toxoplasmosis to cats), or hang out with other cats. ? have someone else handle the lit- ter box. if you must do it yourself, use disposable gloves and wash your hands when you\'re finished, as well as after you touch your cats. the litter should be scooped at least daily. ? wear gloves when gardening. don\'t garden in areas where your cats (or other cats) may have deposited feces.","title" : "the family

like cleaning products and bpa? and what about tap water-is it safe to drink it while i\'m pregnant?\" a little perspective goes a long way when you\'re expecting. the reality is that your home is probably a very safe place for you and your baby to hang out-especially if you couple a little caution with a lot of common sense. here\'s what you need to know about so-called household hazards: household cleaning products. mopping your kitchen floor or polishing your dining room table may be tough on your pregnant back, but it\'s not typically tough on your pregnancy. still, it makes sense to clean with care when you\'re expecting. let your nose and the following common sense tips be your guide: ? go green. as much as you can, prefer products that clean the green way, with nontoxic ingredients (many are surprisingly effective). going green when you clean is a good habit to get into now, before baby starts crawling around your home (and trying to put everything into that cute little mouth). ? if the product has a strong odor or fumes, don\'t breathe it in directly. use it in an area with plenty of ventilation, or don\'t use it at all. ? never (even when you\'re not preg- nant) mix ammonia with chlorine-based products. the combination produces deadly fumes. ? try to avoid using products such as oven cleaners that are plastered with warnings about toxicity levels. ? wear rubber gloves when you must use a really strong product. not only will this spare your hands a lot of wear and tear, but it\'ll prevent the absorption of chemicals through the skin. lead. exposure to lead isn\'t potentially harmful just to small children but to pregnant women and their fetuses as well. fortunately, there are steps you can take to reduce lead exposure around your house, allowing you to bring baby home to a safer environment. here\'s how to steer clear of some common sources of lead: ? check your tap. since tap water is a common source of lead, be sure yours is lead-free (see facing page). ? check your paint. old paint is a major source of lead. if your home dates back to 1955 or earlier and layers of paint are to be removed for any reason, stay away from the house while the work is being done. if you find paint is flaking in an older home, or if you have a piece of old painted furniture that\'s flaking, see about having the walls or furniture repainted to contain the flaking lead paints, or have the old paint removed-again, stay away while the job is being done. ? check your china. flea market fan? lead can also be leached from antique, handmade, and imported ceramicware and pottery. if you\'re unsure whether your ceramic, clay, or other china dishes, bowls, or pitchers are lead-free (look for a label), don\'t use them for food or drinks. using them for decoration is fine. ? check your unusual cravings. pica, a craving for nonfood items, can lead some expectant moms to consume soil, clay, or paint chips, any of which may contain lead. tap water. it\'s still the best drink in the house-and in most houses, water is completely safe and drinkable straight from the tap. to be sure that when you fill a glass of water you\'ll be drinking to your good health-and your baby\'s- do the following: ? contact your local water supplier or health department, the epa (epa.gov), or a consumer advocacy group. if there is a possibility that your home\'s or your community\'s water supply is unsafe (because of pipe deterioration, a contaminated water source, or proximity to a waste disposal area, or because of odd taste or color), arrange to have it tested. your local epa or health department can tell you how. ? if testing reveals your water is con- taminated with unsafe contaminants, invest in a filter (the kind depends on what turns up in your water) or use bottled water for drinking and cooking. be aware, however, that bottled waters are not automatically free of impurities. some contain more than tap water, and some are actually bottled directly from a tap. many bottled waters also don\'t contain fluoride, an important mineral, especially for growing teeth (your baby\'s). to check the purity of a particular brand, search for it at nsf international (nsf.org) or check the bottle\'s label for nsf certification. also look for bottles that don\'t contain bpa (see page 76) by checking for the recycling code \"1\" on the bottom. avoid distilled waters (from which beneficial minerals have been removed). ? if testing shows lead in your water, switch to bottled water or water that comes from a filtration system certified to reduce or eliminate lead for cooking, drinking, and brushing your teeth. bathing and showering using water that has tested positive for lead is not a problem since lead from water can\'t be absorbed through the skin. ? if your water smells and/or tastes like chlorine, boiling it or letting it stand, uncovered, for 24 hours will allow much of the chemical to evaporate. pesticides. can\'t live with roaches, ants, and other yucky insects? fortunately, pest control and pregnancy can be completely compatible, with a few precautions. if your neighborhood is being sprayed, avoid hanging around outside for long periods until the chemical odors have dissipated, usually about 2 to 3 days. when indoors, keep the windows closed. if spraying for roaches or other insects is necessary in your apartment or house, be sure all closets and kitchen cabinets are tightly closed and all food-preparation surfaces are covered. ventilate with open windows until the fumes have dissipated. once the spray has settled, make sure food-preparation surfaces in or near the sprayed area have been thoroughly cleaned. inside the house, use \"motel\" or other types of traps, strategically placed in heavy bug traffic areas, to get rid of roaches and ants. use cedar blocks instead of mothballs in clothes closets, and use the least toxic or most environmentally friendly (aka green) pesticides possible. also, whenever possible, try to take a natural approach to pest control. for example, invest in an infantry of ladybugs or other beneficial predators (available from some garden supply houses) that like to feed on the bugs that are bugging you. most important, keep in mind that brief, indirect exposure to insecticides or herbicides isn\'t likely to be harmful (though best to avoid, if possible). what does increase the risk is frequent, long-term exposure, the kind that working daily around such chemicals (as in a factory or heavily sprayed fields or gardens) would involve. paint. is baby\'s room getting a makeover that includes painting? happily, today\'s paints don\'t contain lead or mercury, so they\'re safe to use when you\'re pregnant. and there are plenty of eco-friendly paints-ones made without volatile organic compounds (vocs), toxic fungicides, and chemical pigments-on the market that you can use for your baby\'s nursery. still, even if the paint you\'re using isn\'t potentially harmful, the actual painting may be, so there are plenty of good reasons why you should pass the paintbrush to someone else-even if you\'re trying desperately to keep busy in those last weeks of waiting. the repetitive motion of painting can be a strain on back muscles already under pressure from the extra weight of pregnancy-and balancing on a ladder is precarious for the pregnant, to say the least. what\'s more, paint odors (though most are not harmful) can offend the pregnant nose and bring on a bout of nausea-a good reason to try to arrange to be out of the house while the painting is being done. whether you\'re there or not, keep windows open for ventilation. avoid exposure to paint removers entirely, because they are highly toxic, and steer clear of the paint-removing process (whether chemicals or sanders are used), particularly if the paint that\'s being removed is older and might contain mercury or lead. bpa. excessive exposure to bpa (bisphenol-a)-a chemical found in some plastic containers, cans, and even some store receipts-may pose a pregnancy risk. that\'s because bpa is believed to mimic hormones and disrupt the endocrine system that\'s responsible for assuring proper fetal development. bpa is everywhere (according to the cdc, 93 percent of all americans have bpa in their bloodstreams), but the good news is that it\'s becoming easier to avoid excessive exposure. you can do this by: ? opting for canned foods that are labeled \"bpa-free\" or choosing food packaged in glass jars instead ? selecting storage containers, cutting boards, and utensils made from bpa-free plastic or from glass, wood, or ceramic ? using stainless steel or \"bpa-free\" water bottles (those with recycle codes \"3\" and \"7\" are more likely to contain bpa) phthalates. phthalates, sometimes known as plasticizers, come from compounds that enhance the flexibility of plastics. they\'re found in iv tubing, flexible pvc pipes used for plumbing, some flexible plastic bags (like single-use shopping bags), and some food and drink containers, among a variety of other products. phthalates are also found in many personal care products, from fragrances to lipstick, shampoo to nail polish-and there\'s a growing case against them. research has found that excessive exposure to phthalates during pregnancy can damage cells and dna in the body, possibly leading to pregnancy complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth, and miscarriage. too much exposure to phthalates in utero has also been linked to lower iq and higher risk of learning disabilities in children. the good news is that more products are being manufactured without phthalates. you can reduce exposure not only by choosing products labeled \"phthalate-free\" but also by watching out for the word \"fragrance\" (a blanket term that can hide phthalates) on the ingredient list of a product not labeled \"phthalate-free.\" also cut back on the use of plastic (use cloth bags instead of plastic, and use glass food and drink containers instead of plastic). not ready to give up on plastic storage containers altogether? choose ones from the growing number that are labeled bpa- and phthalate-free, or at least be sure not to heat up foods or drinks in regular plastic containers, since heating plastics allows the chemicals to break down and leach into the food.","title" : "household hazards"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 446,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"can city air pollution hurt my baby?\" t ake a deep breath. ordinary breath-ing in the big city is a lot safer than you\'d think. after all, millions of women live and breathe in major cities across the nation and give birth to millions of healthy

birthweight, having a higher risk of autism, or developing asthma later in life. here\'s how to breathe easier for two: ? pay attention to outdoor air qual- ity. try to limit time spent outdoors when the air quality is poor and keep windows closed. check the air quality near you with the american lung association\'s state of the air app (lung.org/healthy-air). ? fuel up at night. filling your gas tank after dusk, especially during warmer months, releases less harmful pollution than fueling up by day. ? have the exhaust system on your car checked to be sure there is no rusting or leakage of noxious fumes. never start your car in the garage with the garage door closed, and keep the tailgate on an suv or minivan closed when the engine is running. ? idle wisely. keep your car windows and outdoor air vents closed in heavy traffic, and avoid standing near idling cars. ? don\'t run, walk, or bike along con- gested roads, since you breathe in more air-and pollution-when you\'re active. instead, choose a route with little traffic and a lot of trees. trees, like indoor greenery, help to keep the air clean. ? keep indoor air clean. the epa recommends changing the air filters on hvac units regularly. another tip: place potted plants around your home, since research shows they can actually suck up irritating chemicals like formaldehyde, leaving your air cleaner. in making your selections, however, be sure to avoid plants that are toxic when ingested, such as philodendron or english ivy. you won\'t likely be munching on shrubbery, but the same can\'t necessarily be said for your baby once he or she begins crawling around the house. ? make sure fireplaces, gas stoves, and wood-burning stoves in your home are vented properly. also, make sure the fireplace flue is open

regular. or your chiropractor has had your (once aching) back for years. maybe you\'ve tried acupuncture a few times for headaches, or dabbled in hypnotherapy when you were trying to quit smoking. maybe a monthly therapeutic massage is your drug-free answer to a chill pill (and speaking of drug-free, maybe you\'re a regular in the herbal supplement aisle, too). or maybe you\'ve always been curious about these and other complementary and alternative medicine (cam) therapies-but couldn\'t help thinking that cam might just be a scam. and maybe, now that you\'re expecting, you\'re wondering whether cam has a place in your pregnancy. after all, pregnancy isn\'t an illness, it\'s a normal part of the life cycle-making the holistic view of health and well-being that cam encompasses (which integrates not only physical influences, but nutritional, emotional, and spiritual ones, too) seem like a pregnancy natural. and for more and more pregnant women-and the traditional medicine doctors and midwives who care for them-it is. a variety of cam practices are currently being used in pregnancy, with varying degrees of success, including the following: acupuncture. acupuncture is based on correcting imbalances and blockages of what chinese medicine refers to as qi, or chi (pronounced chee), the flow of vital energy along internal energy pathways (known as meridians) in your body. it might sound a little on the fringe-or even off the wall-but acupuncture has been working its medical magic for thousands of years to relieve any number of pregnancy woes and conditions. how is it done? an acupuncturist inserts dozens of thin needles at prescribed points (there are more than 1,000 acupuncture points) along invisible meridians on the body. lost you at \"needles\"? most people say acupuncture doesn\'t hurt at all, or only for a moment (just don\'t watch if the needles unnerve you-close your eyes and get some much-needed relaxation). researchers have found that the points correspond to deep-seated nerves, so that when the needles are twirled (or electrically stimulated, in a procedure known as electropuncture), the nerves are activated, leading to the release of endorphins-and relief from stress, depression, back pain, fatigue, headaches, sciatica, carpal tunnel pain, and possibly other pregnancy symptoms like heartburn and constipation. acupuncture has also been shown to be particularly good at easing morning sickness even in its most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, and it may also be used during labor to relieve pain, as well as to help speed progress along. acupuncturists say just a single treatment per month during pregnancy can help you de-stress and enjoy this amazing (if sometimes uncomfortable) time in your life more fully. be sure to choose an acupuncturist who is experienced and uses clean and sanitary procedures (meticulously sterilized or single-use disposable needles, for example). and your acupuncturist should avoid having you lie flat on your back after your 4th month. acupressure. acupressure-or shiatsu-works on the same principle as acupuncture, except that instead of poking you with needles, your practitioner will use thumb or finger pressure, or will apply firm pressure with small beads, to stimulate the points. pressure on a certain point just above your inner wrist can ease nausea (which is why acupressure wristbands can also work; see page 137). acupressure on the center of the ball of the foot is said to help back labor. in fact, acupressure is said to relieve the same aches, pains, and symptoms of pregnancy that acupuncture does. there are several acupressure points (such as those in the ankle) that are said to induce contractions-which is why these particular pressure points should be avoided until term (at which point, impatient moms-to-be might want to give them a try). moxibustion. this cam therapy combines acupuncture with the burning of mugwort, an herb. in addition to-or instead of-inserting needles into your skin, the practitioner will burn long sticks of mugwort near certain acupuncture points. though most scientific research shows a low success rate, many in the cam community say that moxi-bustion performed on the outside of the little toe can turn a breech baby. if you\'re thinking of trying moxibustion- or your practitioner has suggested giving it a go-look for an acupuncturist who is experienced in the technique. it generally requires multiple sessions, starting sometime between the end of the 7th month and the middle of the 8th month. chiropractic medicine. this therapy uses physical manipulation of the spine and other joints to enable nerve impulses to move freely through an aligned body, encouraging the body\'s natural ability to heal. during pregnancy your body produces ligament-relaxing hormones-a good thing, since your baby\'s head would never be able to fit through your pelvis otherwise. but those hormones, combined with your spectacularly swollen belly, can leave you loose-limbed, swaybacked, and unusually clumsy because of a rapidly lowering center of gravity (look out below!). all of this can do quite a number on your spine. chiropractic care may be able to undo much of this damage and get your lower body in proper alignment for an easier birth. some chiropractors also claim that chiropractic adjustments can reduce the likelihood of miscarriage, control morning sickness, and lower your risk of preterm delivery. the chiropractor\'s ability to realign and, in many cases, relax the ligaments and muscles in your pelvis has led to what is known as the webster technique, a method that is said to help breech babies turn themselves, naturally. it\'s very important that any chiropractic practitioner you see has experience treating expectant women. you should be placed on a special table made to keep pressure off your belly during treatments, and your chiropractor should avoid having you lie flat on your back, especially during your last trimester. finally, as with any type of cam treatment, make sure you clear it first with your ob, who may have a very specific reason you should avoid spinal realignment. massage. ahhhh . . . massage. anyone who\'s ever had a professional massage knows that both body and mind feel better after a good rubdown. and studies back up the feel-good message about massage, showing that it can reduce stress hormones in your body and relax and loosen tense muscles-all welcome benefits when you\'re expecting. it can also increase blood flow and circulation-good for you and baby-and keep your lymphatic system working at peak efficiency, flushing out toxins from your body. but massage is more than just a day in the spa (which you can read more about on page 153). massage in the hands of a trained physical therapist can help relieve joint pain, neck and back pain, hip pain, leg cramps, and sciatica. it can also reduce swelling in your hands and feet (as long as that swelling isn\'t a result of preeclampsia), relieve carpal tunnel pain, and alleviate headaches and sinus congestion-all common side effects of baby making. because physical therapists create individualized treatment plans for pain relief, yours can teach you stretches and exercises that you can do at home to help relieve any aches and pains you\'re experiencing. many of these stretches are also designed to improve the strength, flexibility, and stability in your muscles. and in most cases, practitioner-prescribed physical therapy is covered by insurance. reflexology. similar to acupressure, reflexology is a therapy based on the notion that areas on the feet and hands are linked to other areas and organs of the body. reflexology is used to treat symptoms in many parts of your body by using fingertip pressure on specific areas on your feet primarily, and sometimes on your hands as well. the idea is that this pressure allows blocked energy to flow freely, which increases blood flow to the corresponding part of your body and an uptick in the removal of toxic wastes. during pregnancy, reflexology can be used to soothe the aches and pains in your back and joints that are taking a beating from your growing girth. but that\'s not all. reflexologists say their fancy footwork can give you relief from some of your most persistent and wide-ranging woes. these may include morning sickness, heartburn, mild swelling, constipation, high blood pressure (but not preeclampsia), insomnia, bladder problems, and even hemorrhoids. in addition, reflexology seems to reduce emotional stress and ease mild depression and anxiety. it may even be helpful after you give birth-some studies show it stimulates milk production. it\'s important to know that reflex-ologists often work on the area between your ankle and heel to stimulate labor and contractions. unless you\'ve reached full term, make sure the therapy avoids stimulating this area for any length of time. as with almost any alternative therapy, check with your practitioner before you begin reflexology treatments, and be sure that your reflexologist has been properly trained and has experience working with pregnant women. keep in mind, too, that some reflexologists prefer to wait until an expectant mom is out of her first trimester before working on her, and that there are certain complications for which reflexology is specifically not recommended. hydrotherapy. the therapeutic use of warm water is particularly effective during pregnancy because the body\'s physiological response to water helps improve your circulation, ease your aching back (and feet, knees, you name it), ease the pain of labor and delivery, and generally make you a happier mama. there are a variety of ways to harness the power of water. soaking in a warm tub is one of them. during labor, spraying your face with cold water may help you concentrate and stay calm. a cold compress on your neck may help you breathe more steadily and deeply, and increase energy while decreasing exhaustion. a warm compress placed on the lower back can help your pelvic muscles relax between contractions. some women believe so deeply in the power of hydrotherapy that they choose to spend much of their labor immersed in water, and some even deliver their babies there. one reason water works so well is that floating eases pressure on your spine, helping the pelvis to open. once you\'re in the tub (or a special birthing pool), you no longer need to concentrate on your posture- your body is decompressed, which helps minimize the pain of contractions. since it\'s important to keep your body temperature in a safe range during pregnancy, think soothingly warm, not blisteringly hot, when it comes to your tub water. and while hydrotherapy is fine (actually, amazing) for almost any pregnant woman and an awesome option for pain management during labor, delivering underwater is usually reserved for low-risk births. meditation, visualization, and relax- ation techniques. deep relaxation techniques, meditation, and visualization can help you cope with a variety of physical and emotional stresses during pregnancy (from the miseries of morning sickness to the pain of labor and delivery), enabling you to relax and focus your concentration, reduce stress, lower your blood pressure, and enhance your peace of mind. they can work wonders on an expectant mom\'s anxiety, too. see page 148 for a relaxation exercise you can try, or try a meditation app that can transport you to your happy place as needed. hypnotherapy. hypnosis-when your conscious (rational) mind takes a backseat and your subconscious mind (feelings, memories, emotions) drives the car for a while-usually involves music, soothing images, and guided visualization. natal hypnotherapy (the kind that\'s used during pregnancy) uses deep relaxation and the power of suggestion to tap into the part of your mind that\'s responsible for bodily functions (your heart rate, hormone production, and digestive system, as well as your emotions) and helps you cope with the anxiety that\'s sometimes part of the pregnancy package. many women use hypnosis to ease (or even eliminate) the pain of childbirth (see page 335), but proponents say hypnosis can also be effective in relieving pregnancy symptoms (from nausea to headaches), helping to hold off premature labor, ease stress, or help turn a breech baby. keep in mind that hypnosis isn\'t for everyone. about 25 percent of the population is highly resistant to hypnotic suggestion, and many more aren\'t suggestive enough to use it for effective pain relief (though even then, there can be relaxing benefits). hypnosis is also not a last-minute option-you\'ve got to learn (and practice) hypnosis techniques in advance of labor for it to be effective. and of course, make sure any hypnotherapist you use or train with is certified and experienced in pregnancy therapies. biofeedback. biofeedback is a method that helps patients learn how to recognize and control their biological responses to physical pain or emotional stress. how does it work? your therapist applies sensors to your body that provide feedback on factors such as muscle tension, brain-wave activity, respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. as the practitioner monitors the feedback these sensors provide, he or she uses relaxation techniques to calm you, reducing muscle tension and easing your pain or stress. over time, you should be able to control your body\'s responses by yourself through self-guided relaxation, without needing the therapist or the biofeedback machine. biofeedback can be used safely to lower blood pressure and combat depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as to relieve a variety of pregnancy symptoms, including headache, backache, and other pains, plus insomnia and possibly morning sickness. it can also be an effective treatment for urinary incontinence, both during and after pregnancy. herbal remedies. \"botanicals\" have been used since humankind first began looking for relief from ailments. now more often manufactured than foraged for, herbal remedies are touted by some as a natural treatment for many of pregnancy\'s peskiest symptoms, from leg cramps to hemorrhoids. and while some are probably harmless and possibly effective (say a cup of chamomile tea when you get up in the morning to calm a queasy tummy, or a cup of raspberry leaf tea to jump start contractions when your due date has come and gone), most experts don\'t recommend herbal remedies for pregnant women because adequate studies on safety haven\'t been done. also important to keep in mind: just because a product is natural doesn\'t mean it\'s safe. in fact, there are certain herbs that are known to be dangerous during pregnancy (and that might be lurking in herbal remedies without you even knowing). for instance, aloe,","title" : "complementary and alternative medicine"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 448,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "c learly, cam is making an impact in pregnancy care. even the most traditional obs are realizing that it\'s a holistic force to be reckoned with, and one to begin incorporating into ob business as usual. but in making cam a part of your pregnancy, it\'s wise to proceed with sensible caution and with these caveats in mind: ? the \"c\" stands for complementary. so check in with your traditional practitioner before you book an appointment with a cam therapist. even better, ask for therapist recommendations first. ? the \"m\" stands for medicine. cam medications can be strong medicine, just as traditional prescriptions or over-the-counter medication can be, but with an important distinction: because they are not fda regulated or approved, their safety hasn\'t been clinically established. which is not to say there aren\'t cam medications that are safe to use during pregnancy, just that there is no official system in place to determine those that are and those that aren\'t (or those that are effective and those that aren\'t). all the more reason to avoid any herbal or homeopathic remedy, as well as any dietary supplement or aromatherapy treatment, unless it has been prescribed or recommended by your ob or midwife-same as you would do with any other medication during pregnancy. ? cam rules change during pregnancy. you\'ve been seeing the same chiropractor for the same adjustments for years? or getting a massage from the same therapist every time your back acts up? just remember: what\'s safe for the nonpregnant may not be safe when you\'re expecting. that\'s why you should choose a therapist who is trained and experienced in the special precautions needed for pregnant patients. barberry, black cohosh, blue cohosh, dong quai, feverfew, goldenseal, juniper, and wild yam are uterine stimulants and could potentially lead to miscarriage or premature contractions. autumn crocus, mugwort (used for moxibustion, but not safe for ingestion), pokeroot, and sassafras have been linked to birth defects. comfrey and mistletoe can have a toxic effect. another reason to proceed with care down the herbal aisles of your health food market: herbal supplements are not regulated by the fda the way prescription and over-the-counter medications are. though herbal remedies manufactured in germany, poland, austria, and the u.k. are regulated, which means they undergo careful scrutiny, those produced in other countries (including the u.s.) are not. this means their strength, quality, and even ingredients may vary from brand to brand and package to package. they may contain contaminants (possibly including lead, depending on the country of origin), ingredients not listed on the label, higher levels of active ingredients than listed, or no active ingredients at all. so treat herbal remedies (including herbal teas) as you would treat any medication during pregnancy: don\'t use them unless they\'ve been cleared by your practitioner.","title" : "cam caveats"}},"add" : {"doc" :

detectable level of hcg in your urine. and the only way you\'ll have a detectable level of hcg in your urine (unless you\'ve been receiving fertility treatments) is if you\'re pregnant. which means that if your test is showing a line, no matter how faint it is-you can be positive that you\'re pregnant. just why you\'re getting a faint line instead of that loud-and-clear line you were hoping for may have to do with the sensitivity of the test you\'ve used. to figure out how sensitive your pregnancy test is, look for the milli-international units per liter (miu/l) measurement on the packaging. the lower the number, the better (20 miu/l will tell you you\'re pregnant sooner than a test with a 50 miu/l sensitivity). not surprisingly, the more expensive tests usually have greater sensitivity. keep in mind, too, that the farther along in your pregnancy you are, the higher your levels of hcg. if you\'re testing very early on in your pregnancy (before your expected period), there might not be enough hcg in your system yet to generate a no-doubt-about-it line. give it a couple of days, test again, and you\'ll likely see a line that\'ll erase your doubts once and for all.","title" : "a faint

nerve-racking, especially if you\'ve been told to skip the hpt and hold off until a blood test can be done (which, depending on your fertility clinic, may be a week to 2 weeks after conception or embryo transfer). but there\'s a very good reason why most fertility specialists prescribe this approach: hpts can provide unreliable results for fertility patients. that\'s because hcg, the hormone tested for in an hpt, is often used in fertility treatments to trigger ovulation and may remain in your system (and show up in your urine) even if you\'re not pregnant. usually, if the first blood test given by your fertility specialist is positive, it will be repeated in 2 to 3 days. why the repeat blood test? your doctor will not only be looking to see that there\'s hcg in your system, but also making sure the level of hcg increases by at least two-thirds (indicating that all is going well so far). if it has increased, another blood test will be ordered 2 to 3 days later, when the hcg level should have increased by two-thirds or more again. these blood tests will also measure hormones (like estrogen and progesterone) to make sure they are at the level they should be to sustain a pregnancy. if all 3 blood tests point to a pregnancy, then an ultrasound is scheduled around 5 to 8 weeks of pregnancy to look for the heartbeat and a gestational sac (see page 170).","title" :

some reason never completes implantation. instead of turning into a viable pregnancy, it ends in a period. though experts estimate that up to 70 percent of all conceptions are chemical, the vast majority of women who experience one don\'t even realize they\'ve conceived (certainly in the days before hpts, women didn\'t have a clue they were pregnant until much later). often, a very early positive pregnancy test and then a late period (a few days to a week late) are the only signs of a chemical pregnancy, so if there\'s a downside to early testing, you\'ve definitely experienced it. medically, a chemical pregnancy is more like a cycle in which a pregnancy never really occurred than a true miscarriage. emotionally, for women like you who tested early and got a positive result, it can be a very different story. though it\'s not technically a pregnancy loss, the loss of the promise of a pregnancy can also be understandably upsetting for both you and your partner. reading the information on coping with a pregnancy loss in chapter 20 can help you with those emotions. and keep in mind that the fact that conception did occur once for you means that it\'ll more than likely

ingredients in making a healthy baby. so don\'t delay. as soon as you have a positive hpt result, call your practitioner to schedule an appointment. just how soon you\'ll be able to come in for that appointment may depend on office traffic and policy. some practitioners will be able to fit you in right away, while some very busy offices may not be able to accommodate you for several weeks or even longer. at certain offices, it\'s routine to wait until a woman is 6 to 8 weeks pregnant for that first official prenatal visit, though some offer a \"pre-ob\" visit to confirm a pregnancy as soon as you suspect you\'re expecting (or have the positive hpt results to prove it). but even if your official prenatal care has to be postponed until midway through the first trimester, that doesn\'t mean you should put off taking care of yourself and your baby. regardless of when you get in to see your practitioner, start acting pregnant as soon as you see that positive readout on the hpt. you\'re probably familiar with many of the basics, but don\'t hesitate to call your practitioner\'s office if you have specific questions about how best to get with the pregnancy program. you may even be able to pick up a pregnancy packet ahead of time (many offices provide one, with advice on everything from diet do\'s and don\'ts to prenatal vitamin recommendations to a list of medications you can safely take) to help fill in some of the blanks. of course, you\'ll also find plenty of pregnancy advice in this book. in a low-risk pregnancy, having the first prenatal visit early on isn\'t considered medically necessary, though the wait can be hard to handle. if the waiting\'s stressing you out, or if you feel you may be a high-risk case (because of a chronic condition or a history of miscarriages, for instance), check with the office to see if you can come in earlier.

should you count 9 months from today? or from when you might have conceived? or is it 40 weeks? and 40 weeks from when? you just found out you\'re pregnant, and already you\'re confused. when is this baby coming, anyway? take a deep breath and get ready for pregnancy math 101. as a matter of convenience (because you need some idea of when your baby will arrive) and convention (because it\'s important to have benchmarks to measure your baby\'s growth and development against), a pregnancy is calculated as 40 weeks long-even though only about 30 percent of pregnancies actually last precisely 40 weeks. in fact, a full-term pregnancy is considered to be anywhere from 39 weeks to 41 weeks long (a baby born at 39 weeks isn\'t \"early\" any more than one born at 41 weeks is \"late\"). but here\'s where things get even more confusing. the 40 weeks of pregnancy are not counted from the day (or passionate night) your baby was conceived-they\'re counted from the first day of your last menstrual period (or lmp). why start the clock on pregnancy before sperm even meets egg (and before your ovary even releases the egg)? the lmp is simply a reliable day to date from. after all, even if you\'re pretty positive about ovulation day (because you\'re a master of cervical mucus or an ovulation predictor pro), and definitely sure about the day or days you had sex, you probably can\'t pinpoint the moment egg and sperm got together (aka conception). that\'s because sperm can hang out and wait for an egg to fertilize up to 3 to 5 days after they\'ve arrived through the vagina, and an egg can be fertilized up to 24 hours after it\'s been released- leaving a wider window than you might think. so instead of using an uncertain conception date as a start date for pregnancy, you\'ll use a sure thing: your lmp, which (in a typical cycle) would have occurred about 2 weeks before your baby was conceived. which means you\'ll have clocked in 2 of those 40 weeks of pregnancy by the time sperm and egg actually meet, and 4 weeks by the time you miss your period. and when you finally reach that 40-week mark, your baby bun will have been baking for just 38 weeks. still confused by the system? that\'s not surprising-it\'s a confusing system. happily, you don\'t have to understand the system to work it. to arrive at a due date (called an edd, or estimated due date, because it\'s always an estimate), you can just do this simple calculation: subtract 3 months from the first day of your last menstrual period (lmp), then add 7 days. for example, say your last period began on april 12. count backward 3 months, which gets you to january 12, and then add 7 days. your due date would be january 19. don\'t feel like doing any math at all? no need to. just plug your lmp date into the what to expect app and-baby bingo!-your edd will be calculated for you, you\'ll find out the week of pregnancy you\'re in, and your week-by-week countdown will begin. keep in mind that if you have irregular cycles, you may have difficulty calculating your due date with the lmp method. and even if your cycles are regular, your practitioner might give you a different date than you arrived at by using the lmp method or an app. that\'s because the most accurate way of estimating a due date is through an early ultrasound, usually done at about 6 to 9 weeks, which reliably measures the size of the embryo or fetus (measurements done by ultrasound after the first trimester aren\'t as accurate). though most practitioners will rely on the ultrasound-plus-lmp method to officially date your pregnancy, there are also other physical signs that may be used to back it up, including the size of your uterus and the height of the fundus (the top of the uterus, which will be measured at each prenatal visit after the first trimester and will reach your navel at about week 20). all signs point to the same date?

then you\'ll want to consider an obstetrician, or ob. an ob can not only provide complete obstetrical care, but can also take care of all your non-pregnancy female health needs (pap smears, contraception, breast exams, and so on). some also offer general medical care, acting as your primary care physician as well. if yours is a high-risk pregnancy, you will very likely need and want to seek out an ob. you may even want to find a specialist\'s specialist, an ob who specializes in high-risk pregnancies and is certified in maternal-fetal medicine. these physicians spend an extra 3 years training to care for women with high-risk pregnancies beyond the typical 4 years of ob-gyn residency training. if you\'ve become pregnant with the help of an infertility specialist, you\'ll probably start your prenatal care with him or her, then \"graduate\" to a general ob or midwife (typically toward the end of the first trimester, though possibly sooner)-or, if your pregnancy turns out to be high-risk, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. more than 90 percent of women select an ob for their care. if you\'ve been seeing an ob-gyn you like, respect, and feel comfortable with for your gynecological care, there may be no reason to switch now that you\'re pregnant. if your regular gyn care provider doesn\'t do ob, or if you\'re not convinced this is the doctor you\'d like to have caring for you during pregnancy or while delivering your baby, it\'s time to start shopping around. the family physician. family physicians (fp) provide one-stop medical service. unlike an ob, who has had post-medical school training in women\'s reproductive and general health as well as surgery, the fp has had training in primary care, maternal care, and pediatric care after receiving an md. if you decide on an fp, he or she can serve as your internist, ob-gyn, and, when the time comes, pediatrician. ideally, an fp will become familiar with the dynamics of your family and will be interested in all aspects of your health, not just your obstetric ones. if your pregnancy takes a turn for the complicated, an fp may send you to an ob for consultation or for more specialized care, but will remain involved in your care for comforting continuity. the certified nurse-midwife. if you\'re looking for a practitioner who will put more caring into your ob care, take extra time with you at prenatal visits, be as attentive to your emotional wellbeing as your physical condition, offer more detailed nutritional advice and comprehensive breastfeeding support, be open to more complementary and alternative therapies and more birth options, and be a strong advocate of unmedicated childbirth, then a certified nurse-midwife (cnm) may be right for you (though, of course, many doctors fit that profile, too). a cnm is a medical professional-an rn (registered nurse) or a bsn (bachelor of nursing science) who has completed graduate-level programs in midwifery and is certified by the american college of nurse-midwives. a cnm is thoroughly trained to care for women with low-risk pregnancies and to deliver uncomplicated births. in some cases, a cnm may provide continuing routine gyn care and, sometimes, newborn care. most midwives work in hospital settings, and others deliver at birthing centers and/or do home births. ninety-five percent of births with cnms are in hospitals or birthing centers. though cnms have the right in most states to offer pain relief, as well as to prescribe labor-inducing medications, a birth attended by a cnm is less likely to include such interventions. on average, midwives have much lower cesarean delivery rates (performed by their affiliated obs) than physicians, as well as higher rates of vaginal birth after cesarean (vbac) success-in part because they\'re less likely to turn to unnecessary medical interventions, and in part because they care only for women with low-risk pregnancies, who are less likely to end up needing a surgical delivery. studies show that for low-risk pregnancies, deliveries by cnms are as safe as those by physicians. something else to keep in mind, if you\'ll be paying some or all of your costs out-of-pocket: the cost of prenatal care with a cnm is usually less than that with an ob. if you choose a certified nurse-midwife (about 9 percent of expectant moms do), be sure to select one who is both certified and licensed (all 50 states license nurse-midwives). most cnms use a physician as a backup in case of complications, and many practice with one or with a group that includes several. for more information about cnms, look online at midwife.org. direct-entry midwives. these mid- wives are trained without first becoming nurses, though they may hold degrees in other health care areas. direct-entry midwives are more likely than cnms to do home births, though some also","title" : "obstetrician?

(and sometimes conflicting) points of view. the major disadvantage is that if your one-of-a-kind doctor is out of town, sick, or otherwise unavailable on the day (or night) your baby decides to arrive, a backup practitioner you don\'t know (in some cases, a laborist; see box, facing page) may deliver your baby. arranging to meet the covering practitioner ahead of time can help you feel more comfortable about that possibility. a solo practice may also be a problem if, midway through the pregnancy, you find that your one-of-a-kind doctor really isn\'t the one you were hoping for after all. if that happens and you decide to switch practitioners, you\'ll have to start from scratch, searching for one who fits your patient profile. partnership or group practice. in this type of practice, two or more doctors in the same specialty care jointly for patients, often seeing them on a rotating basis (though you usually get to stick with your favorite through most of your pregnancy and start rotating only toward the end of your pregnancy, when you\'re having more frequent office visits). again, you can find both obs and family physicians in this type of practice. the advantage of a group practice is that by seeing a different doctor each time, you\'ll get to know them all-which means that when those contractions are coming strong and fast, there\'s sure to be a familiar face in the room with you. the disadvantage is that you may not like all of the doctors in the practice equally, and you usually won\'t be able to choose the one who attends your baby\'s birth. also, hearing different points of view from the various partners may be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on whether you find it reassuring or head-spinning. combination practice. a group practice that includes one or more obs and one or more midwives is considered a combination practice. the advantages and disadvantages are similar to those of any group practice. there is the added advantage of having the extra time and attention a midwife may offer at some of your visits and the extra medical know-how of a physician\'s extensive training and expertise at others. you may have the option of a midwife-attended delivery, plus assurance that if a problem develops, a doctor you know is in the wings. maternity center or birthing center practice. in these practices, certified midwives provide the bulk of the care, and obs are on call as needed. some maternity centers are based in hospitals with special birthing rooms, and others are stand-alone facilities. all maternity centers provide care for low-risk patients only. the benefits of this type of practice are obviously great for moms-to-be who prefer a cnm as their primary practitioner. another possibly sizable advantage may be the bottom line: cnms and birthing centers usually charge less than obs and hospitals. that can be a key consideration, since while your health insurance is required to cover maternity and delivery care, you may need to foot part of the bill, depending on the type of insurance you have, your deductible, and whether you go in or out of network. a potential disadvantage of this kind of care: if a complication arises during pregnancy, you may have to switch your care to an ob and start developing a relationship all over again. or, if a complication comes up during labor or delivery, you may need to be delivered by the doctor on call-someone you may never have met before. and finally, if you are delivering at a freestanding maternity center and complications arise, you may have to be transported to the nearest hospital for emergency care. independent cnm practice. in the states in which they are permitted to practice independently, cnms offer women with low-risk pregnancies the advantage of personalized pregnancy care and a low-tech natural delivery (sometimes at home, but more often in birthing centers or hospitals). an independent cnm should have a physician available for consultation as needed and on call in case of emergency-during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. care by an independent cnm is covered by most health plans, though only some insurers cover midwife-attended home births or births in a facility other than a hospital.","title" : "division of labor"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 462,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "when you have a good idea of the kind of practitioner you want and the type of practice you prefer, where can you find some likely candidates?

delivering in a birthing center is more your speed? hoping for a home birth? pregnancy and childbirth are full of personal choices-often including where you\'ll be welcoming your brand new baby into the world: in a hospital. don\'t think cold and clinical. the birthing rooms at nearly all hospitals are cozy and family-friendly, with soft lighting, comfy chairs, soothing pictures on the walls, and beds that almost look like they came out of a furniture showroom instead of a hospital supply catalog. medical equipment is usually stowed out of sight inside homelike cabinetry. the back of the birthing bed can be raised to support a laboring mom in a comfortable position, and the foot of the bed snaps off to make way for the birthing attendants. after delivery, there\'s a change of sheets, a few flipped switches, and presto, you\'re back in bed. many hospitals also offer showers and/or whirlpool tubs in or adjacent to the birthing rooms, both of which can offer hydrotherapy relief during labor. tubs for water birth are also available in some hospitals (see box, page 326 for more on water birth). most birthing rooms have sleeper sofas for your coach and other guests. most birthing rooms are used just for labor, delivery, and recovery (ldrs), which means you and your baby will most likely be moved from the birthing room to a postpartum room after an hour or so of largely uninterrupted family togetherness. if you end up needing a c-section, you\'ll be moved from the birthing room to the operating room, and afterward to a recovery room-but you\'ll be back in a nice postpartum room as soon as the business of birthing your baby is done. at a birthing center. birthing centers, usually freestanding facilities (often just minutes from a hospital, although they may also be attached to-or even located in-a hospital), offer a cozy, low-tech, and personalized place for childbirth, with softly lit private rooms, showers, and whirlpool tubs for labor and water birth. a kitchen may also be available for family members to use. birthing centers are usually staffed by midwives, but many have on-call obs. and though birthing centers generally do not use interventions such as fetal monitoring, they do have medical equipment on hand so emergency care can be started as needed while waiting for transfer to a nearby hospital. still, only women with low-risk pregnancies are good candidates for delivery in birthing centers. something else to consider: unmedicated childbirth is the focus in a birthing center, and though mild narcotic medications are available, epidurals aren\'t. if you end up wanting an epidural, you\'ll have to be transferred to the hospital. at home. only about 1 percent of the deliveries in the u.s. are home births. the upside of delivering at home is obvious: your newborn arrives amid family and friends in a warm and loving atmosphere and you\'re able to labor and deliver in the familiar comfort and privacy of your own home, without hospital protocols and personnel getting in the way. the downside is that if something unexpectedly goes wrong, the facilities for an emergency cesarean delivery or resuscitation of the newborn will not be close at hand. statistics show that there is a slightly higher risk to the baby in a home birth attended by a midwife compared to a hospital birth attended by a midwife. according to the american college of nurse-midwives, if you are considering a home birth, you should be in a low-risk category, be attended by a cnm with a consulting physician available, and have transportation readily available and live within 30 miles of a hospital. c h a p t e r 2","title" : "where will you give birth?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 466,"author" : "heidi

challenges (congratulations!). and the good news gets even better. being pregnant may actually help with the second challenge. endometriosis causes pain in the pelvic area because tissue from the uterine lining (called the endometrium) grows outside the uterus and reacts to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle by thickening, breaking down, and bleeding (as the uterine lining normally does). during pregnancy, when ovulation and menstruation take a hiatus and progesterone increases, these so-called endometrial implants become smaller and less tender, often inducing a bit of remission from the pain endometriosis causes. in fact, many moms-to-be are symptom-free or nearly so during the entire pregnancy-though some may start to feel discomfort as baby grows and begins packing a stronger punch, particularly if those punches and kicks reach tender areas. the less happy news is that pregnancy provides only a break from the symptoms of endometriosis, not a cure. after pregnancy and breastfeeding (and sometimes earlier), the symptoms usually return. the other less happy news is that women with endometriosis do face an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (so be sure to be alert for associated signs; see page 588), as well as preterm birth. because of these increased risks, your practitioner will likely monitor your pregnancy more frequently (with more frequent ultrasounds, for instance). finally, in the very unlikely case that you\'ve had uterine surgery for your condition, your practitioner will probably opt to deliver via c-section.","title" :

of being infected, the cdc recommends that all expectant mothers be tested early in pregnancy for the stds most likely to pose a serious risk to mom and baby. these include: gonorrhea. gonorrhea has long been known to cause conjunctivitis, blindness, and serious generalized infection in a baby delivered through an infected birth canal. an expectant mom who tests positive for gonorrhea will be treated immediately with antibiotics. treatment is followed by another culture to be sure the mom is infection-free. as an added precaution, an antibiotic ointment is squeezed into the eyes of every newborn at birth. syphilis. because this std can cause a variety of birth defects as well as stillbirth, testing is routine at the first prenatal visit. antibiotic treatment of infected pregnant women before the 4th month, when the infection usually begins to cross the placental barrier, almost always prevents harm to the fetus. the very good news is that mother-to-baby transmission of syphilis is rare. chlamydia. more common than syphilis or gonorrhea and occurring most often in sexually active women under age 26 (especially those who have had multiple partners), chlamydia is the most common infection passed from mother to baby, and is considered a potential risk to both. because half of women infected with chlamydia don\'t have symptoms (which means it\'s possible to have picked it up at some point and not know it), routine screening is important. the best time to treat chlamydia is before pregnancy. but prompt treatment with antibiotics (usually azithro-mycin) during pregnancy can prevent transmission of the infection to baby (in the form of pneumonia, which fortunately is usually mild, and eye infection, which is occasionally severe) at delivery. the warts clear without treatment within a couple of months. how does having an active case of genital hpv affect a pregnancy? luckily, it\'s unlikely to affect it at all. occasionally, however, the hormonal changes of pregnancy can cause the warts to multiply or get larger. if that\'s the case with you, and if the warts don\'t seem to be clearing on their own, your practitioner may recommend treatment during pregnancy- especially if the warts get so big that they obstruct your birth canal. the warts can be safely removed by freezing, electrical heat, or laser therapy. if they\'re not impacting your pregnancy, this treatment may be delayed until after delivery. if you do have hpv, your practitioner will also check your cervix to make sure there are no cervical cell irregularities. but even if abnormalities are found, any necessary cervical biopsies to remove the abnormal cells will likely be postponed until after your baby arrives. worried about whether your baby can catch your hpv infection? don\'t be. hpv transmission to babies is very low-and even in the unlikely case that a baby does get the hpv virus, it typically clears without treatment. the antibiotic ointment routinely used at birth protects the newborn from chlamydial, as well as gonorrheal, eye infection. trichomoniasis. the symptoms of this parasite-caused std (also referred to as trichomonas infection, or \"trich\") are a greenish, frothy vaginal discharge with an unpleasant fishy smell and, often, itching. about half of those affected have no symptoms at all. though the disease does not usually cause serious illness or pregnancy problems (or affect a baby whose mom is infected), the symptoms can be irritating. generally, expectant moms with symptoms of trichomoniasis are tested, and if found positive for the infection, are treated safely with antibiotics. hiv infection. acog recommends (and most states require) that all pregnant women be counseled about and screened for hiv as early as possible during each pregnancy unless they decline the test (so-called \"opt out testing\"). that\'s because infection in pregnancy by the hiv virus, which causes aids, is a threat not just to the expectant mom but to her baby as well. about 25 percent of babies born to untreated mothers will develop the infection (testing will confirm it in the first 6 months of life). fortunately, the treatments that are now available offer plenty of hope for infected moms and their babies-to-be. treating an hiv-positive pregnant woman with azt (also known as zdv or retrovir) or other antiretroviral drugs can dramatically reduce the risk of her passing the infection on to her baby, without any harmful side effects. for women with a high amount of hiv in their body, delivering by elective c-section (before contractions begin and before membranes rupture) can reduce the risk of transmission even more. if you\'re not sure whether you\'ve been tested for stds, check with your practitioner. testing is a vital precaution to take in pregnancy, even if you\'re pretty certain you couldn\'t be infected with an std. if a test does turn out to be positive, treatment (for both you and your partner, if necessary) will protect not only your health, but that of your baby-to-be. hpv can be prevented with the hpv vaccine, which is recommended for all girls and boys beginning at age 11 or 12 but can also be given through age 26 if it wasn\'t previously. the vaccine is given in a series of 3 doses, and if you started the series and then became pregnant before completing it, you\'ll need to hold off on the remaining doses until after your baby is born.","title" : "other stds and pregnancy"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 475,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" :

contracting the condition if a mom has a recurrent infection (that is, she\'s had herpes before) during pregnancy. second, though a primary infection (one that appears for the first time) in pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage and premature delivery, that kind of infection is uncommon, since pregnant women and their partners are far less likely to participate in at-risk behaviors (such as having unprotected sex with a new partner). even for babies at greatest risk-those whose moms have their first herpes outbreak as delivery nears (again, a very unlikely scenario)-there is an up to 50

accompanied by genital pain, itching, pain when urinating, vaginal and urethral discharge, and tenderness in the groin, as well as lesions that blister and then crust over), call your practitioner. if you picked up your herpes infection before pregnancy, the risk to your baby is very low. to lower it even more, your practitioner will probably give you antiviral meds beginning at week 36 of your pregnancy-even if you don\'t have active lesions. if you end up having active lesions when labor starts, you\'ll probably have a c-section to protect your little one from infection in the birth canal. in the unlikely event a baby is infected, he or she will be treated with an antiviral drug. after delivery, the right precautions can allow you to care for-and breast-feed-your baby without passing along the virus, even during an active infection. your obstetrical history in vitro fertilization (ivf) \"i conceived my baby through ivf. how different will my pregnancy be?\" some well-deserved congratulations on your ivf success! with all you\'ve been through to get to pregnancy, you\'ve earned some smooth sailing- and happily, you\'re likely to get it. the fact that conception took place in a lab instead of in your fallopian tube shouldn\'t impact your pregnancy all that much, at least once the first trimester is over. the same is true for a baby conceived via other fertility treatments (such as icsi or gift). early on, however, there will be some differences in your pregnancy and your care. because a positive test doesn\'t necessarily mean that a pregnancy will stick (particularly since ivf pregnancies are usually confirmed by blood tests super- early on), because trying again can be so emotionally and financially draining, and because it\'s not known right off how many of the transferred embryos are going to develop into fetuses, the first 6 weeks or so of an ivf pregnancy are usually more nerve-racking than most. expect to spend more time in your fertility specialist\'s office-for repeat blood work and ultrasounds. sex and other physical activities may be restricted, and you might even be put on modified bed rest (though studies show that bed rest doesn\'t seem to help boost odds of ivf success). and as an added precaution, the hormone progesterone (and possibly baby aspirin) will likely be prescribed to help support your developing pregnancy during the first 2 to 3 months. but once this extra-cautious period is past (and once you\'ve graduated to your regular prenatal practitioner, usually at about 8 to 12 weeks), you can expect that your pregnancy will be pretty much like everyone else\'s-unless it turns out that you have multiple baby passengers on board, as more than 40 percent of ivf moms do. if you do, see chapter 15.","title" :

pregnancy and a healthy baby can be in your future, as much as you hope for it. but it can be-especially with the right care and the right management. the causes of repeated early miscarriages are sometimes unknown, but there are tests that may shed light on why the miscarriages took place- even if they each had a different cause. trying to determine the cause of a single loss usually isn\'t worthwhile, but a medical evaluation and testing will probably be recommended if you\'ve had 2 or more consecutive miscarriages. recurrent miscarriage was once a mystery far more often than not, but much progress has been made in uncovering its causes. many tests can now pick up risk factors for pregnancy loss, and there are more effective strategies for preventing a future one. so talk to your practitioner to discuss the options in your case, which might include referral to a maternal-fetal specialist. some of the tests you may be offered after your repeat miscarriages include: ? a karyotyping blood test for both you and the baby\'s father to see if either of you carries a balanced translocation-an altered chromosome arrangement, which may be the cause of the miscarriages ? a blood test for antiphospholipid antibodies (antibodies that attack a woman\'s own tissues, causing blood clots that can clog the maternal blood vessels that feed the placenta) ? an ultrasound before pregnancy where saline is infused into the uterus to check for anatomical problems ? an analysis of the chromosomal makeup of the miscarried embryo or fetus, which can help determine a cause for the miscarriages ? tests for vitamin deficiencies ? tests of hormone levels once you know the cause, or causes, you can talk to your practitioner about what kind of treatment or treatments might best protect your next pregnancy. in some instances, patients with a history of early or late miscarriages can benefit from hormone therapy: progesterone for women who appear to be producing too little of this important pregnancy hormone, or a medication to reduce levels of the hormone prolactin in the mother\'s blood if tests show that excess prolactin is the cause. if a thyroid problem is detected, it can be treated easily. even if a cause can\'t be identified and treated, you still have a good chance of sustaining a successful pregnancy. but that may be hard for you to believe or even to hope for. it will be important to find ways of managing any understandable fear that being pregnant again will mean you\'ll miscarry again. yoga, meditation, visualization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises can help with the anxiety, and support can come from other women who\'ve suffered similar losses (you\'ll find plenty of sharing going on in the whattoexpect.com grief and loss forum). communicating your feelings openly with your partner may also help. remember, you\'re in this together. for more on miscarriage, see chapter 20, starting on page 582. for more on detailed information on preventing a repeat pregnancy loss, see what to expect before you\'re expecting. expanding your family (and your belly) again a little sooner than expected? starting another pregnancy before you\'ve fully recovered from the last one can be hard enough without adding stress to the mix. so first of all, relax. though closely spaced pregnancies can take their physical toll on a mom-to-be who just became a mom, there are lots of things you can do to help your body better handle the challenge of back-to-back (or bump-to-bump) baby making, including: ? getting the best prenatal care, starting as soon as you think you\'re pregnant. very closely spaced pregnancies (when there\'s less than 12 months between pregnancies) increases the risk for preterm birth, though getting good prenatal care from the get-go can help reduce that risk. ? eating as well as you can (see chapter 4). your body probably hasn\'t had a chance to rebuild the stores of vitamins and nutrients that were tapped to make your last baby, and that can put you at a nutritional disadvantage, particularly if you\'re still breastfeeding. you may need to overcompensate nutritionally to be sure both you and the baby you\'re currently carrying don\'t get shortchanged. continue taking your prenatal vitamins, of course (or start them up again if you already quit), but don\'t stop there. try not to let lack of time or energy (you\'ll have little of both, that\'s for sure) keep you from eating enough or well enough. healthy grazing may help you fit those much-needed nutrients into your busy schedule, so stock up on wholesome, ready-to-grab munchables like cheese sticks, almonds, freeze-dried fruit, and mini bags of baby carrots to dip in ready-to-serve hummus. ? gaining the right amount of weight. your brand new baby boarder doesn\'t care whether or not you\'ve had time to shed the extra pounds his or her sibling just finished putting on you- which means you\'ll probably have to shelve any plans to drop that baby weight until you deliver this baby. talk over a sensible weight gain goal with your practitioner (which might be the same, lower, or higher than last time). focus on the quality of the food you eat (always important during pregnancy, but especially important when you\'re going back-to-back), but also keep an eye on the scale. ? fair-share feeding. if you\'re breast- feeding your newborn, you can continue as long as you want to and feel up to it (see box, page 30). ? resting up. you need more rest than may be humanly (and new-motherly) possible. getting close to that rest quota will require not only your own determination but help from your spouse and others as well. set priorities, too: let less important chores or work go undone, and force yourself to nap (or at least put your feet up) when your baby is napping. if you\'re not breastfeeding, daddy can take over night feedings. if you are, he can do the baby-fetching at 2 a.m. ? exercising. getting

compatible-which means there\'s probably no need to retire your breasts for the next 9 months if you don\'t want to. have concerns that the oxytocin that\'s released during breastfeeding might cause contractions that could lead to miscarriage or early labor? not to worry. in a low-risk pregnancy, the mild contractions triggered by nursing aren\'t a problem. in fact, until your uterus is ready to switch from baby-boarding to baby-birthing mode (usually around 38 weeks), oxytocin doesn\'t seem to have much effect on the uterus at all. having a hard time keeping anything down, never mind eating well enough to fuel both baby growing and milk production (a combo that can require upward of 800 extra calories per day)? morning sickness can be a drain, literally-and that can deplete you of the nutrients and fluids necessary to nourish the baby that\'s already here and the one that\'s on the way. if nausea and vomiting are especially severe, and if you\'re losing weight early on, discuss this challenge with your practitioner. you both might come to the conclusion that the best choice for all three of you (mom, baby, and baby-to-be) is to wean your firstborn. but if your morning sickness is manageable and you\'re not losing weight-and if your practitioner supports you-you can ride out the first few months and use the remaining 2 trimesters to further bump up your pregnancy weight gain and reestablish those depleted nutrient stores. that way you can be sure you, your baby, and your baby-to-be are getting all the calories and nutrients necessary. concerned that the pregnancy hormones circulating in your system might find their way into your milk? happily, your breast milk is just as safe now that you\'re pregnant, and experts say pregnancy hormones don\'t pass easily to breast milk. wondering whether your breast milk supply might start slowing down once the demands of pregnancy start picking up? it probably will, but usually not until midpregnancy. your breastfeeding baby may or may not notice any slowdown in milk production. another thing your breastfeeding baby may or may not notice: changes in the consistency or taste of your milk supply once colostrum starts being produced (again, usually midway through pregnancy). some little ones decide to self-wean at some point in mom\'s pregnancy (either because of the decreased milk supply or the changes in taste), while others never miss a breastfeeding beat, even after the arrival of a new nurser. in fact, assuming you and your milk supply are still going strong after you\'ve delivered your latest bundle, you can breastfeed both your newborn and your older baby (tandem nursing). if your baby does opt to wean, or if you just don\'t feel up to breastfeeding while you\'re expecting (or you\'re too sick or tired to continue), don\'t feel guilty about calling it quits. you\'ve already provided your little (if soon-to-be-older) one with many of the benefits of breastfeeding, and those continued cuddles and kisses will keep the bond between you as tight as ever. another option if you aren\'t up to full-time breastfeeding but you\'re also not ready to fully wean: do the combo (supplement with formula as needed or wanted). walks will do the trick. or enroll in a pregnancy exercise class or swim at a club or community center that offers babysitting services. or let baby

risk, but i\'m still worried about a repeat.\" congratulations on doing everything you can to make sure your pregnancy is as healthy as possible this time around-and to give your baby the very best chances of staying on board until term. that\'s a great first step. together with your practitioner, there are probably even more steps you can take to minimize the chances for a repeat preterm labor. if you had a previous spontaneous preterm birth, ask your practitioner if you\'re a good candidate for progesterone shots. research shows that giving the hormone progesterone as weekly shots starting at 16 weeks of pregnancy and continuing through week 36 reduces the risk for preterm birth in women who\'ve delivered early before and who are carrying only one baby. your practitioner might also offer you a fetal fibronectin (ffn) screening test, which looks for signs of preterm labor in women who have risk factors for having a premature baby (such as a previous preterm delivery). fetal fibronectin is the glue your body makes to hold your baby in your uterus. if the test-which is done in your practitioner\'s office-comes back negative (meaning the ffn hasn\'t started to break down yet and therefore isn\'t detectable), it means the odds of delivering within the next 2 weeks are less than 1 percent (so you can breathe easy). if it\'s positive, your risk of going into preterm labor is significantly higher, and your practitioner may take steps to prolong your pregnancy and prepare your baby\'s lungs for an early delivery. another screening test for preterm labor in women who have had a prior one is cervical length. the length of your cervix is measured via ultrasound, and if there are any signs that the cervix is short, your practitioner may prescribe a daily progesterone gel-it comes in a tampon-like applicator that you place in your vagina-starting at week 20 of pregnancy and continuing until 37 weeks. if you\'re already on progesterone shots due to a prior premature birth and ultrasound shows that your cervix has shortened midway through pregnancy, your practitioner may recommend cer-clage (stitching the cervix to prevent it from dilating prematurely). see the next question to learn more.","title" : "preterm birth"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 485,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "just about 12 percent of births are considered premature, or preterm- that is, occurring before completion of the 37th week of pregnancy. and around half of these occur in women who are known to be at high risk for premature delivery, including the ever-multiplying percentage of moms-to-be of multiples. is there anything you can do to help prevent preterm birth if your pregnancy profile puts you at higher risk for it? in some cases, there isn\'t: even when a risk factor is identified (and it won\'t always be), it can\'t necessarily be controlled. but in other cases, the risk factor or factors that might lead to an early birth can be controlled or at least minimized. eliminate any that apply to you, and you may up the chances that your baby will stay put until term. here are some known risk factors for premature labor that can be controlled: too little or too much weight gain. gaining too little weight can increase the chances your baby will be born early, but so can packing on too many pounds. conceiving at your ideal body weight and gaining just the right number of pounds for your pregnancy profile can provide your baby with a healthier, more nurturing uterine environment and, ideally, a better chance of staying safely ensconced until term. so set an ideal weight-gain goal with your practitioner-and then try your best to meet it. not enough nutrients. giving your baby the healthiest start in life isn\'t just about gaining the right number of pounds-it\'s about gaining them on the right types of foods. a diet that lacks necessary nutrients (especially folate, the dietary version of folic acid) increases your risk for premature delivery, while a diet that\'s nutrition packed decreases that risk. too much standing or heavy physical labor. definitely no need to sit out pregnancy-in fact, staying active is just what the doctor (or midwife) orders for most moms-to-be. and everyday kind of standing-like when you\'re shopping at the mall or in line at the movies-isn\'t a problem in a normal pregnancy. but if your job involves long hours on your feet every day-especially if it involves heavy physical labor or lifting-check with your practitioner to see if you should cut back or request a change in work duties, especially late in pregnancy. extreme emotional stress. some studies have shown a link between extreme emotional stress (not your everyday, life-in-the-fast-lane, my-work-is-never-done stress) and premature labor. what\'s the difference between a normal stress level and extreme stress? normal stress may keep you on your toes-let\'s face it, even on the run-but it\'s manageable, and you can thrive on it. extreme stress, on the other hand, is unhealthy- it drains and debilitates you, keeps you from sleeping well, keeps you from eating well, keeps you from enjoying life. sometimes the cause of such excessive stress can be eliminated or minimized (by quitting or cutting back at an unhealthily high-pressure job, for example), and sometimes it\'s unavoidable (as when a lost job leaves you with a pile of unpaid bills, or there\'s been an illness or a death in the family). still, many kinds of stress can be reduced with relaxation techniques, a healthy diet, a balance of exercise and rest, and by talking over the problems that are getting you down with your spouse or friends, your practitioner, or a therapist. alcohol and drug use. moms-to-be who use alcohol and illegal drugs increase their risk of having a premature delivery. smoking. smoking during pregnancy may be linked to an increased risk of premature delivery. quitting before conception or as early as possible in pregnancy is best, but quitting at any time in pregnancy is definitely better than not quitting at all. gum infection. some studies show that gum disease is associated with preterm delivery. researchers suspect that the bacteria that cause inflammation in the gums can get into the bloodstream, reach the fetus, and initiate early delivery. another proposed possibility: the bacteria that cause inflammation in the gums can also trigger the immune system to produce inflammation in the cervix and uterus, triggering early labor. regularly brushing and flossing and staying up to date on dental cleanings and other dental care can prevent infections. treating existing infections before pregnancy may also help lower the risk for a variety of complications, including preterm labor. cervical insufficiency. the risk of premature delivery as a result of an incompetent cervix-in which a weak cervix opens early-can possibly be reduced by stitching the cervix closed (cerclage) and/or by closely monitoring the length of the cervix via ultrasound (see page 34 for more). history of preterm birth. your chances of a preterm birth are higher if you\'ve had one in the past. your practitioner may prescribe progesterone shots or gels during this pregnancy to avoid a repeat preterm birth. the following risk factors aren\'t controllable, but in some cases they can be somewhat modified. in others, knowing they exist can help you and your practitioner best manage the risks, as well as greatly improve the outcome if an early birth becomes inevitable: multiples. the optimal time for the delivery of twins is at 38 weeks. but many moms of twins (and more) deliver earlier. good prenatal care, optimal nutrition, and the elimination of other risk factors, along with restriction of activity and more time spent resting in the last trimester, may help prevent a too-early birth. see chapter 15. premature cervical shortening. in some moms-to-be, for reasons unknown and apparently unrelated to cervical insufficiency, the cervix begins to shorten mid-pregnancy, putting them at increased risk for preterm birth. a routine ultrasound of the cervix mid-pregnancy may uncover that increased risk. treatment with progesterone gels or suppositories may be prescribed in some cases to try to prolong pregnancy. pregnancy complications. gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and excessive amniotic fluid, as well as problems with the placenta, such as placenta previa or placental abruption, can make an early delivery more likely. managing these conditions as best as possible may help pregnancy reach term. chronic maternal illness. chronic conditions, and heart, liver, or kidney disease, may raise the risk for preterm delivery, but good care may help prevent complications. general infections. certain infections (some stds, urinary, cervical, vaginal, and kidney infections) can increase the risk for preterm labor. when the infection is one that could prove harmful to the fetus, early labor may be the body\'s way of attempting to rescue the baby from an unhealthy environment. preventing the infection or promptly treating it may prevent a too-soon birth. age. teen moms-to-be are often at a higher risk for preterm delivery. older moms (over age 35) are also more likely to give birth early. good nutrition and prenatal care can help reduce the risk.","title" : "your pregnancy profile and preterm birth"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 486,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i had a miscarriage in the 5th month of my first pregnancy, due to cervical insufficiency. i just had a positive pregnancy test, and i\'m worried that i\'ll have the same problem again.\" the good news (and there is good news here) is that it doesn\'t have to happen again. now that your cervical insufficiency (also known as incompetent cervix) has been diagnosed as the cause of your past pregnancy loss, your doctor should be able to take steps to prevent it from causing another loss. with proper treatment and careful watching, the odds of your having a healthy pregnancy and a safe delivery this time around are very much in your favor. an incompetent cervix, one that opens prematurely under the pressure of the growing uterus and fetus, is estimated to occur in 1 or 2 of every 100 pregnancies, and it is believed responsible for 10 to 20 percent of all second-trimester miscarriages. it\'s usually diagnosed when a woman miscarries in the second trimester after experiencing progressive painless effacement (shortening and thinning) and dilation of the cervix without apparent uterine contractions or vaginal bleeding. while it\'s unclear precisely what causes cervical insufficiency, it may be the result of genetic weakness of the cervix, extreme stretching of or severe lacerations to the cervix during one or more previous deliveries, an extensive \"cone\" biopsy done for precancerous cervical cells, or cervical surgery or laser therapy. a multiple pregnancy can also lead to cervical insufficiency (due to the extra weight of an extra baby pressing on the cervix), but if it does, the problem will not usually recur in a later single-baby pregnancy. to help protect this pregnancy, your ob may perform cerclage-a simple procedure to stitch up the opening of the cervix-when you\'re in your second trimester (anywhere from 12 to 22 weeks). cerclage is done through the vagina under local or epidural anesthesia. twelve hours after surgery, you\'ll be able to resume normal activities, though sex may not be allowed for the rest of your pregnancy, and you may need more frequent prenatal exams. usually the sutures are removed a few weeks before the estimated due date. in some cases, they may not be removed until labor begins, unless there is infection, bleeding, or premature rupture of the membranes. however, there\'s a lot of controversy about how effective cerclage is and whether it should be performed routinely on women who have cervical insufficiency. some doctors will perform it only on a woman with a prior history of preterm birth (one that occurred before 34 weeks) when ultrasound done before 24 weeks shows that the cervix is shortening or opening. others will perform cerclage as a preventive measure between weeks 13 and 16 in women who have had one or more second-trimester losses, even if there\'s no evidence of cervical weakness or shortening. cerclage is not currently recommended for a woman who has a short cervix in the second trimester but hasn\'t had a prior pregnancy loss-in this case vaginal progesterone gel is recommended. cerclage is not performed in a multiple pregnancy, either. whether or not you have a cerclage placed this time,

murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"my doctor said my blood tests show i am rh negative. what does that mean for my baby?\" fortunately, it doesn\'t mean much, at least now that both you and your doctor know about it. with this knowledge, simple steps can be taken that will effectively protect your baby from rh incompatibility. what exactly is rh incompatibility, and why does your baby need protection from it? a little biology lesson can help clear that up quickly. each cell in the body has numerous antenna-like structures, called antigens, on its surface. one such antigen often present on the surface of red blood cells is the rh factor. most people inherit the rh factor (making them rh positive), while other people lack it (making them rh negative)-and whether you\'re rh positive or rh negative doesn\'t much matter, except when it comes to pregnancy. when an rh-negative mom is carrying a baby who\'s rh positive (having inherited the rh factor from an rh-positive dad), mom\'s red blood cells don\'t match up with baby\'s. if the rh-positive fetal blood cells enter the rh-negative mom\'s circulation, her immune system may view them as \"foreign\"-and may mobilize armies of antibodies to attack the foreigner who\'s generating those cells (her baby) in a normal immune response. this is known as rh incompatibility. all pregnant women are tested for the rh factor early in pregnancy, usually at the first prenatal visit. if a mom-to-be turns out to be rh positive, as 85 percent of the population is, the issue of incompatibility isn\'t an issue at all. that\'s because whether the baby is rh positive or rh negative, there are no foreign antigens on fetal red blood cells to cause mom\'s immune system to mobilize against them. when the mother is rh negative, the baby\'s father is tested to determine whether he is rh positive or negative. if you are rh negative and your spouse also turns out to be rh negative, your baby will be rh negative, too (since two \"negative\" parents can\'t make a \"positive\" baby), which means that your red blood cells and baby\'s are compatible, and there\'s no potential for a problem. but if your spouse is rh positive, there\'s a significant possibility that the baby will inherit the rh factor from him, creating an incompatibility between you and your little one. this incompatibility is usually not a problem in a first pregnancy because there aren\'t yet antibodies to the baby\'s rh factor. but once a mom\'s natural protective immune response kicks in and produces antibodies during her first pregnancy or delivery (or abortion or miscarriage), they stay in her system-which isn\'t a concern until she becomes pregnant again with another rh-positive baby. during the subsequent pregnancy, these antibodies could potentially cross the placenta into the baby\'s circulation and attack the fetal red blood cells, causing very mild (if maternal antibody levels are low) to very serious (if they are high) anemia in the fetus. prevention of the development of rh antibodies is the key to protecting the baby when there is rh incompatibility. most practitioners use a two-pronged strategy. at 28 weeks, an rh-negative expectant mom is given a vaccine-like injection of rh-immune globulin, known as rhogam, to prevent the development of antibodies. another dose is administered within 72 hours after delivery if blood tests show her baby is rh positive. if the baby is rh negative, no treatment is required. rhogam should also be administered after a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy, an abortion, cvs (chorionic villus sampling), amniocentesis, vaginal bleeding, or physical trauma during pregnancy. giving rhogam as needed at these times can head off problems in future pregnancies. what if an rh-negative mom-to-be has already developed levels of rh antibodies capable of causing anemia in an rh-positive fetus? first, the baby\'s father will be tested for the rh factor, if he hasn\'t already been. if he is rh positive, then baby\'s blood type will be checked. this can be done through amniocentesis or a noninvasive blood test (though not all insurance","title" : "rh

your partner for major life events (like anniversaries, holidays, and graduations) is just a part of everyday life. and you\'ve probably come to accept that, if not exactly embrace it (especially at those times when you could really use an embrace). but what about when you\'re expecting-and he\'s expecting to be deployed? how do you stay connected when you\'re separated during the ultimate life event, pregnancy-and even separated at your baby\'s birth? with a little creativity-and a lot of technology. here are some ideas to get you started: ? document your bump. start every morning with a bump selfie. it may not seem to change much from day to day, but getting a daily bump update in his inbox will make his day, every day. plus you\'ll both get a kick out of looking back on your tummy transformation from flat to fabulously round later on. as you close in on delivery, consider splurging on a maternity photo shoot meant just for him. ? decorate your bump. ready to unleash your inner artist-while keeping close during holidays? send holiday greetings on your bump: mark july 4th with a flag, halloween with a pumpkin, thanksgiving with a turkey, christmas with a tree. ? follow along together. start a long- distance baby book club-get him a matching copy of this book, and later, what to expect the first year, so you can read along together. download the what to expect app together, so you can watch the videos and share the updates on your baby\'s progress-as well as help him understand all those crazy symptoms you\'ve been venting about. play the name game, too-share a baby name app and toss around contenders. ? take him to checkups. if time zones and schedules permit, try to book some of your prenatal checkups when he can attend via videochat (and make sure he gets a chance to ask any questions he has). same for any ultrasound appointments. if he can\'t videochat in for the appointments, try to get a selection of ultrasound stills or video clips to send him. and for his listening pleasure, try recording baby\'s heartbeat. ? connect over cravings. can\'t get enough black olive and peanut butter sandwiches? bananas for bananas? create a cravings care package so he can get a taste of home-and a taste for what you\'re craving. find substitutes for items that won\'t travel well (like the bananas-you can send him a bag of the freeze-dried kind). or send him a photo of the extreme sundae baby had you building at 2 a.m. last night. companies will cover the blood test, since it\'s pricey). if the fetus is rh negative, mother and baby have compatible blood types and there\'s no cause for concern or treatment. if the fetus is found to be rh positive, and the mother\'s antibody levels have reached a critical level, a special ultrasound test will be performed every week or two to assess the baby\'s condition and rule out anemia. if at any point anemia has developed, a transfusion of rh-negative blood to the fetus may be necessary. this is done through a small needle placed in the fetal umbilical cord under ultrasound guidance. such fetal transfusions are very effective and associated with excellent outcomes. ? do a long-distance gender reveal. if you\'re planning to find out your baby\'s sex when he (or she) reveals it at your 20-week ultrasound or via an elaborate gender-reveal party, make sure daddy\'s able to join in. videochat during the reveal, or have the friend or relative who\'s gotten the gender 411 pack up matching boxes of pink or blue confetti or candy to send to him and give to you, to be opened via videochat at the same time. ? get him bonding with baby. from about the 6th month on, a baby\'s sense of hearing is well developed. so put it to good use-and let the bonding begin. whenever you\'re videochatting or on the phone, put the audio close enough to your bump so baby can hear the sound of daddy\'s voice-which will already be music to your little one\'s ears. that way, baby will recognize daddy\'s voice right from the start. another way to bond: put together a highlights reel to send to him of baby\'s hiccups, pokes, and squirms once they\'re visible from the outside. ? go shopping together. so maybe he doesn\'t have the time to scroll through pages of cribs, strollers, and monitors (and maybe he\'s just as happy that way), but he\'d probably like to vote on the finalists once you\'ve narrowed the nursery and gear field a bit. same for paint colors and theme choices for baby\'s room. take step-by-step pictures as you remodel baby\'s room or nook (make sure you\'re not doing the painting and heavy lifting). and sign up for your online baby registry together online. ? find the support you need. every mom-to-be needs a strong support system-a shoulder to cry on, someone to vent to, someone to cheer her on or share special moments with. you need it-and deserve it-even more. connect with other military moms-to-be, online or on base, supporting each other and sharing resources. the local u.s.o. can provide support and programs that bring moms together, too, as well as help with resources. enlist a friend or relative to be your stand-in coach if your partner won\'t be home for delivery (hopefully, you\'ll be able to videochat every step of the way), and take childbirth classes (and breastfeeding classes, and infant cpr classes) together. also consider adding a doula to your birthing team (see page 328). many doulas offer services free or at a discounted rate to military moms, especially those who have a partner deployed. and if you feel you need more than a friend to talk to-if you\'re feeling depressed or anxious, having trouble eating or sleeping or taking care of yourself, ask your practitioner for help. professional counseling, possibly combined with a support group, can help immeasurably. ? get centered. if there\'s a centering pregnancy program at your base, consider signing up for the extra support and camaraderie it offers. see page 14 for more. fortunately, the use of rhogam has greatly reduced the need for transfusions in rh-incompatible pregnancies to less than 1 percent. a similar incompatibility can arise with other factors in the blood, such as the kell antigen, though these are less common than rh incompatibility. if the mother doesn\'t have the antigen and the father does, there is again potential for problems. a standard screening, part of the first routine blood test, looks for the presence of circulating antibodies in the mother\'s blood. if these antibodies are found, the baby\'s father is tested to see if he is positive, in which case the management is the same as with rh incompatibility.","title" : "expecting deployment"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 489,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'m about 60 pounds overweight. does this put my baby and me at higher risk during pregnancy?\" most overweight moms (and even those who are obese, defined as someone whose weight is 20 percent or more over ideal weight), have completely safe pregnancies and completely healthy babies. still, carrying a lot of extra weight while you\'re carrying a baby does increase the possibility of certain pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, birth defects, stillbirth, preterm birth, high blood pressure, and gestational diabetes (gd). being overweight poses some practical pregnancy problems, too. the extra layers of fat may make it trickier for a practitioner to determine a fetus\'s size and position (as well as make it harder for you to feel those first kicks). and a prolonged labor and difficult delivery can result if a baby is much larger than average, which is often the case when mom is obese (particularly if she\'s diabetic, and even if she hasn\'t gained too much weight during pregnancy). and if a cesarean delivery is necessary, obesity can complicate both the surgery and recovery from it. then there\'s the issue of pregnancy comfort, or rather discomfort-and unfortunately, as the pounds multiply, so do those uncomfortable pregnancy symptoms. extra pounds (whether they\'re pounds you already had or pounds you added during pregnancy) can spell extra backache, varicose veins, swelling, heartburn, and more. discouraged? don\'t be. there\'s plenty you and your practitioner can do to minimize the extra risks of those extra pounds (as well as the extra discomforts)-it\'ll just take some extra effort. on the medical side, you may be monitored more closely than the typical average-weight woman (for instance, you may be screened for gd earlier and more often, and have extra ultrasounds to check your baby\'s size). as for your part, good self-care can make a big difference. eliminating all pregnancy risks that are within your control-such as drinking and smoking-will be particularly important for you. keeping your weight gain on target will be, too-and it\'s likely that your target will be smaller than the average expectant mom\'s and monitored by your doctor more closely. acog recommends that overweight women gain 15 to 20 pounds and obese women gain no more than 15 pounds, though your practitioner\'s recommendations may differ. in fact, some practitioners recommend that obese women pack on no extra pounds at all during pregnancy- but again, stick to the plan your doctor or midwife has mapped out for you. even with a scaled-down bottom line to stick to, your daily diet should be packed with foods that are concentrated sources of vitamins, minerals, and protein (see the pregnancy diet, starting on page 84). focusing on the quality of the calories you choose will make them count-and will help your baby get the most nutritional bang from every bite you take. taking your prenatal vitamin faithfully will provide extra insurance. getting regular exercise, within the guidelines recommended by your practitioner, will allow you to eat more of the healthy foods you and your baby need without packing on too many pounds. combine regular exercise, the right amount of weight gain, and a healthy diet, and you\'ll also lower your risk of developing gd. wondering whether you can keep your pregnancy weight gain down by popping supplements and sipping beverages that claim to suppress appetite? these can be dangerous during pregnancy, so stay away from them-even if they\'re marketed as \"natural.\" for your next pregnancy, if you are planning on one, try to get as close as possible to your ideal weight before you conceive. it will make everything about pregnancy a lot easier-and less potentially complicated.","title" :

super-skinny side (with a bmi of 18.5 or less; see page 178 for how to calculate yours), you\'ll have to be filling up your plate even more. that\'s because there are some potential risks (such as having a small-for-date baby and preterm birth) associated with being pregnant and extremely underweight, particularly if you\'re also undernourished (this is far less likely if you\'re a healthy eater who just happens to be naturally thin). but any added risk can be eliminated by eating well (getting plenty of calories and nutrients), taking a prenatal vitamin, and gaining enough weight. depending on where you started out on the scale, your practitioner may advise you to gain a little extra-possibly 28 to 40 pounds, instead of the 25 to 35 pounds recommended for the average-weight woman. if you\'ve been blessed with a speedy metabolism that makes putting on pounds tricky, see page 192 for some tips. as long as your weight gain stays on track, though, your pregnancy shouldn\'t

for a double congratulations- you\'ve lost a whole lot of weight, and you\'re about to gain a baby! pat yourself on the back (and rub yourself on the belly), because having lost all that weight (no matter how it happened- gastric sleeve, lap band, or gastric bypass) gives you an even better chance of having a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby. you\'ve lowered your risk for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and having a too-big baby. how\'s that for a win-win? still, there are some extra precautions you will need to take as a mom-to-be who\'s had weight loss surgery: ? keep your weight loss surgeon on your team (now, team baby). he or she will be best able to advise your ob or midwife on some of the specific needs of a weight loss surgery patient. ? keep those vitamins coming. you\'ll need to keep up with your recommended vitamin supplementation while you\'re expecting-after all, you\'re nourishing for two now. a prenatal vitamin is a good start, but you may need more iron, calcium, folic acid, vitamin b12, and vitamin a because of certain malabsorption issues. so discuss your supplement needs with both your prenatal practitioner and your surgeon. ? keep your eye on the scale. you\'re used to watching your weight, of course-but lately, you\'re used to watching it go down. now that there\'s a baby on board, you\'ll probably watch it go up. your job will be to keep to that weight-gain goal-gaining too few pounds or too many can put your pregnancy and your baby at unnecessary risk. keep in mind that there\'s an increased chance of having a too-small baby after bariatric surgery, but that gaining the right number of pounds can help ensure a healthy bottom line for your baby at birth. ? keep an eye on your eating. eating for two is more challenging when your stomach space has been downsized by weight-loss surgery. you may find the challenges multiply, too, as your uterus and your baby start to grow, crowding out your stomach even more. since the quantity of food you can comfortably eat is limited, you\'ll need to focus on quality. try not to waste space (or calories) on foods that don\'t satisfy nutritional requirements, and instead try to choose foods that efficiently pack the most nutrients into the smallest volume. ? keep an eye on your symptoms. if you\'re experiencing excessive vomiting or nausea, or if you notice any unusual abdominal pain, call your pregnancy practitioner and your bar-iatric surgeon right away. the symptoms could be pregnancy-related-or they could be something more serious related to your surgery, in which case they would require immediate medical attention. in the first place. but the studies that have been done suggest that bingeing and purging during pregnancy (in other words, active bulimia) seems to increase the risk of miscarriage and premature birth, as well as postpartum depression. active anorexia during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and cesarean delivery. taking laxatives, diuretics, appetite suppressants, and other drugs sometimes used by bulimics and anorexics can also be harmful during pregnancy. they draw off nutrients and fluids from your body before they can be used to nourish your baby (and later to produce milk), and may lead to multiple serious problems, including possible birth defects, if used regularly. and not gaining enough weight during pregnancy can lead to a number of problems, including preterm delivery and a baby who is born small for his or her gestational age. happily, the studies also suggest that if you put those unhealthy habits behind you now, you\'re just as likely to have a healthy baby as anyone else, all other things being equal. if you\'re having trouble eating normally and well, having a hard time distinguishing between morning sickness and bulimia, or if you\'re hiding your bulimia under the cover of morning sickness, make sure you get the help you need. start by telling your prenatal practitioner about your eating disorder-not only so he or she can help make sure it doesn\'t affect your baby or your pregnancy, but also so you\'ll get the supportive care you need to get healthy and stay healthy. your practitioner may be able to refer you to a therapist who is experienced in treating eating disorders. professional counseling is always smart when you\'ve been battling anorexia or bulimia, but it\'s really essential when you\'re trying to eat well for two. you may also find support groups helpful (check online, or ask your practitioner or therapist for a recommendation). just being committed to conquering your eating disorder, so that you can start nurturing that beautiful baby of yours, is the first and most important step. it will also help to put the dynamics of pregnancy weight gain in perspective. keep in mind: ? the pregnant shape is universally viewed as healthy and beautiful. its roundness is normal, a sign that you\'re growing a baby. celebrate those curves! embrace your pregnant self! ? you\'re supposed to gain weight dur- ing pregnancy. the right amount of weight (as recommended by your practitioner), gained at the right time, on the right foods is vital to your baby\'s growth and wellbeing in utero and beyond (some of the extra fat you lay down during pregnancy will be used after delivery to help you breast-feed your baby). and this sensible strategy isn\'t just baby-friendly, it\'s mom-friendly, too. it will help ensure a healthier, more comfortable pregnancy and a speedier return to your prepregnancy shape postpartum. if you\'re uneasy watching the numbers on the scale climb as you gain that vital weight, let your practitioner do the watching. hide your bathroom scale so you won\'t be tempted to check your weight yourself, and close your eyes during your checkup weigh-ins (ask the nurse to note the number in your chart without announcing it first). ? you can (and should!) stay in shape when you\'re expecting. exercise can help

"heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "anyone who\'s lived with a chronic condition knows that life can get pretty complicated-between medications to take and extra doctor\'s appointments to make (not to mention, new therapies and treatments to keep up with). add pregnancy into the mix, and you\'ve got your plate even fuller. happily, with some extra precautions, extra effort, and extra care, most chronic conditions are completely compatible with pregnancy. here are some general recommendations for moms-to-be with a few common chronic conditions (but be sure to follow your doctor\'s orders, since they\'ve probably been tailored to your specific needs): diabetes. the key to managing a diabetic pregnancy successfully-whether the diabetes is type 1 (in which the body doesn\'t produce insulin) or type 2 (in which the body doesn\'t respond as it should to insulin)-is achieving normal blood glucose levels before conception and maintaining them throughout the 9 months after it. you\'ll be able to do that with a carefully designed diet (it will probably be similar to the pregnancy diet, containing few sugary sweets and refined grains and plenty of fiber-rich food and healthy snacks), regular exercise, careful monitoring of your blood sugar, and the right medication (insulin, if necessary). you also will be given a pregnancy weight-gain goal, which will be especially important to stick to since gaining too much weight can put you at risk of pregnancy complications. to make sure all is going well, you\'ll be watched carefully during pregnancy. along with regular tests for blood sugar levels you\'ll also have urine tests (to check kidney function) and eye exams (to check your retinas), and your baby will be checked with a fetal echocardiogram (to make sure his or her heart is developing without problems). your doctor will also watch you closely for early signs of preeclampsia (page 550) and gestational diabetes (page 548), since diabetics are at somewhat higher risk for both those conditions. because babies of diabetics sometimes grow very large, even if mom\'s weight is on target, your baby\'s growth will be monitored more closely using ultrasound. heavier babies make delivery more difficult (there\'s a higher chance of childbirth complications and/ or cesarean delivery when baby is very large). early delivery may be necessary if problems develop late in pregnancy, but your medical team will ensure that baby\'s lungs are sufficiently mature before inducing labor or performing a c-section. finally, if you\'re planning to breast-feed, try to get started as soon as possible after birth (ideally within 30 minutes) and feed every 2 to 3 hours to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). to play it safe, babies of diabetic moms are usually not discharged from the hospital until they are maintaining blood glucose levels and feeding well. hypertension. if you have chronic hypertension your pregnancy will be considered high risk. but with the right medical care and self-care, you\'re likely to have the best payoff of all-a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby. you\'ll have to keep track of your blood pressure at home, exercise regularly (which lowers blood pressure), reduce stress (through relaxation exercises, mediation, and other cam therapies, such as biofeedback), eat well, stay hydrated, and keep your weight gain on track. pregnancy-safe medication, as needed, will also help ensure that your blood pressure stays under control. medical monitoring will be stepped up, too, to make sure you don\'t develop preeclampsia (see page 550). irritable bowel syndrome. it\'s hard to pinpoint the effect of pregnancy on ibs-and vice versa-because bowels are often impacted (sometimes literally) by pregnancy. expectant women are more prone to constipation (a symptom of ibs) and/or looser stools (also a symptom of ibs). same for gas and bloating, which typically worsen when you\'re expecting, whether or not you have ibs. to keep your symptoms manageable, stick to the techniques you\'re used to using to combat ibs during other times in your life: eat smaller, more frequent meals, stay well hydrated, avoid excess stress, and steer clear of foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse. if you\'re on the fodmap diet, check with your practitioner to make sure you\'re getting the right balance of nutrients for pregnancy. and if you\'re on medication for help with ibs symptoms, check with your prenatal practitioner to make sure it\'s pregnancy safe-not all are. you might also want to consider adding some probiotics. they\'re surprisingly effective in regulating bowel function. sickle cell anemia. this condition puts pregnancy at high risk, but with the right care moms with sickle cell disease-even those with complications like heart or kidney disease-have a good chance of having a safe pregnancy and delivery and a healthy baby. preeclampsia and hypertension are more common in women with sickle cell anemia, and many women with sickle cell anemia find themselves hospitalized at least once during their 9 months. complications such as miscarriage, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction are also more common. though it\'s not certain whether it\'s beneficial or not, it\'s possible that you\'ll be given a blood transfusion at least once or even periodically throughout pregnancy as well as in early labor or just before delivery. thyroid disease. if you\'re hypothyroid (your thyroid doesn\'t produce enough thyroxine), it\'s important to keep taking your thyroid pills (they\'re not only pregnancy safe but can be pregnancy essential). you\'ll also need to have your thyroid levels monitored more closely to be sure the dose you\'re taking is meeting your needs and your baby\'s (and if you\'ve had a thyroid condition in the past but since stopped taking meds, let your practitioner know so your levels can be tested again now). untreated hypothyroidism increases the chances of miscarriage. what\'s more, babies who don\'t get enough maternal thyroid hormones in the first trimester can develop neurological problems and, possibly, deafness. (after the first trimester, the fetus makes its own thyroid hormones and is protected even if mom\'s levels are low.) low thyroid levels are also linked to maternal depression during pregnancy and postpartum-another compelling reason to continue treatment. iodine deficiency, which is becoming more common among women of childbearing age in the u.s. because of reduced iodized salt consumption, can interfere with the production of the thyroid hormone, so be sure you are getting adequate amounts of this trace mineral. untreated moderate to severe graves disease (aka hyperthyroidism-when the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones) can lead to serious complications for both you and your baby, including miscarriage and preterm birth, so appropriate treatment is necessary. happily, when the disease is treated properly (in pregnancy the treatment of choice is the antithyroid medication propylthiouracil, or ptu, in the lowest effective dose), the outcome is likely to be good for both mom and baby. don\'t see the chronic condition you\'re dealing with listed here? you\'ll find asthma on page 219, scoliosis on page 255, and information on other chronic conditions, including cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, multiple sclerosis, pku, physical disability, and rheumatoid arthritis at whattoexpect.com. but make sure any exercise you do is pregnancy-appropriate and practitioner-approved. if you\'ve always used strenuous workouts as a way to burn off extra calories you\'ve eaten, it\'s time to trade in that strategy for a healthier approach. also avoid any exercise that raises your temperature excessively, which isn\'t safe during pregnancy (saunas and hot yoga are out). ? you will lose a lot of the pregnancy pounds at delivery, but far from all of them. it can take several months to lose the rest, and realistically longer to get back into shape. for this reason, women with eating disorders sometimes find that negative feelings about their body image cause them to slip back into bingeing and purging or starving during the postpartum period. because these unhealthy habits could interfere with your ability to recover from childbirth, to parent effectively, and to produce enough milk if you choose to breastfeed, it\'s important that you continue professional counseling postpartum with someone experienced in the treatment of eating disorders. support groups (in your community or online) can also help. the most important thing to keep in mind: your baby\'s wellbeing depends on your wellbeing during pregnancy. if you\'re not well nourished, your baby won\'t be, either. positive reinforcement can definitely help, so try putting pictures of cute babies on the fridge, in your office and car, anywhere you might need a reminder of the healthy eating you should be doing. visualize the food you eat making its way to your baby (and your baby happily gobbling up those healthy meals). if you can\'t seem to stop bingeing, vomiting, using diuretics or laxatives, or practicing semistarvation during pregnancy, discuss with your physician the possibility of hospitalization until you get your disorder under control. there\'s never been a better reason to get-and stay-healthy.","title" : "if you have a chronic condition"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 494,"author" : "heidi

round 15 percent of women of childbearing age battle bouts of depression, so you\'re far from alone. luckily for you and all the other expectant moms who share your condition, there\'s a sunny forecast: with the right treatment, women with depression can have perfectly normal pregnancies- and happy ones, too. deciding what that treatment should consist of during pregnancy is a delicate balancing act, however, when it comes to the use of medications. together with your mental health care provider and your prenatal practitioner, you\'ll need to weigh the risks and benefits of taking such meds- and not taking them-while you\'re growing a baby. maybe it seems like a simple decision to make, at least at first glance. after all, could there ever be a good reason to put your emotional wellbeing over your baby\'s physical wellbeing? but the decision is actually a lot more complicated than that. for starters, pregnancy hormones can do a number on your emotional state. even women who\'ve never had an encounter with mood disorders, depression, or any other psychological condition may experience wild emotional swings when they\'re expecting- but women with a history of depression are at greater risk of having depressive bouts during pregnancy and are more likely to suffer from postpartum depression. and this is especially true for moms-to-be who stop taking their antidepressants during pregnancy. what\'s more, untreated depression isn\'t likely to affect only you (and those you\'re close to)-it\'s also likely to affect your baby\'s health. depressed moms-to-be may not eat or sleep well or pay as much attention to their prenatal care, and they may be more likely to turn to unhealthy lifestyle habits, like drinking or smoking. any or all of those factors, combined with the debilitating effects of excessive anxiety and stress, have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and a lower apgar score for babies. treating depression effectively, however-and keeping it under control during pregnancy-allows a mother-to-be to nurture her body and her developing baby. so what does all this mean for you? it means you should think twice before you consider tossing your antidepressants. but it also means that you should consult both with your prenatal practitioner and the doctor and/or therapist who has been treating you for depression before you decide what your next medication move should be, if any. certain meds are safer than others during pregnancy, and some aren\'t recommended for pregnancy use at all-which means that the med (or meds) you used preconception might not be the right choice now. or that your dose may need to be changed. your prenatal practitioner (in conjunction with your mental health care provider) can give you the most up-to-date and accurate information on the safety of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy, because it\'s ever changing-as well as often misinterpreted or misreported on the internet. another reason to look to professional guidance (instead of search engines): research so far has been conflicting, with some studies showing increased risk for autism, cardiac defect, and low birthweight in babies whose moms took certain antidepressants during pregnancy, and other studies showing no correlation at all. what is known right now is that the ssris (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) celexa, prozac, and zoloft are generally considered good options during pregnancy (paxil, another ssri, is not, because it\'s associated with a small increase in fetal heart defects). snris (serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors) such as cymbalta and effexor xr, are also among the treatment options for expectant moms. wellbutrin isn\'t considered a first choice medication during pregnancy but can be used if a woman isn\'t responding to the other options. here\'s the important thing to keep in mind as you and your practitioner weigh your options: though taking any kind of medicine during pregnancy- including antidepressants-isn\'t without risks, experts believe these risks shouldn\'t keep pregnant women from taking antidepressants if their depression can\'t be treated effectively in other ways. that\'s because untreated depression carries its own risks, many with long-term effects. choosing the safest medication possible, prescribing it at the safest dose possible, and taking it at the safest time during pregnancy as possible will help mitigate the risks of both the depression and the medications. also remember that there are nondrug treatments for depression that can be quite effective, either on their own (in some cases, allowing a mom with mild depression to avoid medication altogether) or when used in conjunction with medication (allowing a mom to take a lower dose of a medication or switch to a safer med). these treatments include psychotherapy (talk therapy), bright light therapy, and complementary and alternative medicine (cam) approaches, such as acupuncture and possibly neurotherapy. exercise (for its release of feel-good endorphins), meditation (which can help you manage stress), and diet (keeping blood sugar up with regular healthy meals and snacks) can also be beneficial additions to a treatment program. talk to your practitioner and mental health care provider to see if these options have a place in yours.","title" : "depression"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 495,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i was diagnosed with adhd as a teenager

the second). any potential risk of taking the medications during pregnancy will, of course, have to be balanced against the potential risks of letting your adhd go untreated. ask, too, about nondrug

wonder what my age means for my pregnancy and my baby.\" b eing over 35 and pregnant with your first baby means you\'re in good- and steadily growing-company. also growing: the number of moms over 40 having baby number 1. and your good company shares good news. the risks of pregnancy are very small to begin with, and rise only slightly and gradually as you get older. most of the risks that do rise can be reduced, or even eliminated. so first, the risks. the major reproductive risk faced by a woman over 35 (an age group perhaps unfairly referred to as \"advanced maternal age,\" or ama) is that she might not become pregnant at all due to the slight and very gradual decline in fertility that begins once a woman has exited the optimum fertility window of her early 20s (so it\'s not downhill overnight at age 35). now that you\'ve got conception covered (congrats!), you face a somewhat increased chance of having a baby with down syndrome. here, again, it\'s a relatively low risk that increases gradually as mom gets older: 1 in 1,250 for 25-year-old moms, about 3 in 1,000 for 30-year-old moms, 1 in about 300 for 35-year-old moms, and 1 in 35 for 45-year-old moms. it\'s speculated that the gradual rise in this and other chromosomal abnormalities is most often linked to an older woman\'s older eggs (women are born with a lifetime supply of eggs that gradually age along with her). that said, because an estimated minimum 25 percent of down syndrome cases and other chromosomal abnormalities are the result of a defect in an older dad\'s sperm-and because older moms are often married to older dads-it\'s not always clear whether it\'s mom\'s age or dad\'s age that\'s implicated. a handful of other pregnancy risks increase slightly with age. one may not sound like a risk at all, but a benefit: older moms are more likely to conceive twins (even if they\'ve conceived naturally), thanks to an age-related predisposition to releasing more than one egg at a time. in general, increasing age also increases the risk of miscarriage (because of an older mom\'s older eggs), preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm labor. labor and delivery, on average, are longer and slightly more likely to be complicated (often because the pregnancy is higher-risk to begin with), with c-section rates higher in older moms, too. but even though the risks of pregnancy at your age are slightly elevated, they are still low-and of course, they\'re nothing when compared to the reward you\'re eagerly anticipating. best of all, f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "having a baby after

limited to fertilization. only during the 20th century (too late to help those queens who lost their heads for failing to produce a male heir) was it discovered that a father\'s sperm holds the deciding genetic vote in determining his child\'s gender. and only in the last few decades have researchers started realizing that an older father\'s sperm might also contribute increased risks for his baby, too. like the older mother\'s eggs, the older father\'s spermatocytes (undeveloped sperm) have had longer exposure to environmental hazards and might be more likely to contain altered or damaged genes or chromosomes. what does that mean for an older dad\'s baby-to-be? researchers have found that, regardless of the mom\'s age, a couple\'s risk of miscarriage increases as the dad\'s age increases, as does the incidence of down syndrome once he\'s over 50 or 55 (again, no matter what mom\'s age). there also seems to be a somewhat increased risk of autism or mental health issues when a dad is over age 40. wondering whether your older age will mean more diagnostic tests for your partner and your baby? genetic counselors don\'t recommend invasive tests like amnio or cvs based only on a dad\'s age-and happily, the screening tests that are offered routinely to every mom-to-be (no matter how old she or her partner is) can rule out most chromosomal problems. the bottom line if you\'re an older dad, as it is for older moms: the risks are very small-and the benefits of having a baby at the time in your life that\'s right for you are clearly great. really, really great. so relax and enjoy this pregnancy adventure together-it\'ll be worth the wait. pregnancy complications that are more common in older moms can sometimes be prevented, and if not, they can usually be well controlled. the right combination of medical management and medications can help forestall preterm labor, and breakthroughs continue to decrease risks in the birthing room. and though down syndrome isn\'t preventable, it can be identified in utero through a variety of screening and diagnostic tests. better still, today\'s essentially noninvasive first-trimester screenings (see page 53), which are recommended for all pregnant women regardless of age (so don\'t worry, mama-you\'re not being picked on!), are much more accurate than in the past. moms who pass these screens don\'t necessarily have to proceed to more invasive diagnostic tests (amnio or cvs) as was once routine, even if they\'ve passed their 35th birthday. this saves time, money, and-most important-stress. but as much as obstetrical science can do to help you have a safe pregnancy and delivery and a healthy baby, it\'s nothing compared to what you can do yourself through exercise, eating well, sensible weight gain, and regular prenatal care. just being older doesn\'t necessarily put you in a high-risk category, but an accumulation of many individual risks can. eliminate or minimize as many risk factors as you can, and you\'ll be able to take years off your pregnancy profile-making your chances of delivering a healthy baby virtually as good as those of a younger mother. yes, maybe even better. so relax, enjoy your pregnancy, and be reassured. there\'s never been a better time to be over 35 and expecting a baby.","title" : "older dads"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 498,"author" : "heidi

of more than 300 diseases, and it gives you the power of knowing whether you and your partner are at risk of passing along any of these genetic conditions to a baby you conceive together. if you both

having a baby with a defect) undergo several screening tests during their 40 weeks. that\'s because screening tests are noninvasive and increasingly accurate. they pose no risk to mom (except maybe to your nerves) or baby-but can provide a lot of beneficial reassurance. an easy way to breathe easy. prenatal screening tests use a blood draw and/or ultrasound to identify whether you\'re at an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder like down syndrome or a neural tube defect like spina bifida. they can\'t diagnose such conditions-only a diagnostic test can do that-but they can determine the likelihood that your baby is affected, with anywhere from 80 to 99 percent accuracy. here\'s what you need to know about each of them. noninvasive prenatal screening (after 9 weeks). did you know that pieces of your baby\'s dna circulate in your bloodstream? the noninvasive prenatal screening test (nipt, or nips) involves a simple blood screening any time after 9 weeks that analyzes dna (it\'s called cell-free fetal dna, or cfdna) to pinpoint baby\'s risk for a number of genetic disorders, including down syndrome. nipt is a screening test, which means it can only tell you the likelihood of your baby having a disorder (with the added bonus of letting you know your baby\'s sex-if you want to find out, that is)-not if your baby definitely has (or doesn\'t have) a disorder. the companies that perform these new screening tests say that nipt creates far fewer false positives than standard blood screenings (like the quad screening; see page 56). the results can help you and your practitioner decide next steps, including whether invasive diagnostic tests-which are even more precise but carry some risk-are worth that risk. because nipt involves only a quick blood draw with a needle and syringe, all you\'ll need to do is offer up your arm at the practitioner\'s office or a lab-so it\'s perfectly safe for you and baby. your sample is then sent off to a lab, which will check the dna in your blood for signs of an elevated risk of abnormalities. once the results of your nipt are back, your practitioner will likely pair them with the results of your first-trimester ultrasound or nuchal translucency screening (see below) to determine whether more testing is needed. if it\'s positive, your practitioner will recommend following up with amniocentesis (see page 59) or cvs (see page 58) to confirm the result and check for other problems nipt can\'t detect, such as neural tube defects. because nipt is relatively new, it\'s not fda approved. currently, acog recommends that nipt be offered only to women at higher risk of carrying a baby with a chromosomal abnormality (such as moms-to-be who are 35 or older or those who previously had a child with a genetic disorder, or who have a family history of a genetic disorder), not to low-risk women. nipt is not recommended at all for women carrying multiples or those who are using a donor egg. before you go through with nipt, check with your insurance plan to find out if it\'s fully covered-and if not, what it will cost you. nuchal translucency screening (10 to 13 weeks). the nuchal translucency (nt) screening test-basically a specialized ultrasound-lets you know if you\'re at an increased risk for having a baby with a chromosomal problem such as down syndrome. unlike diagnostic tests, however, the nt screening can\'t give you a definitive answer about whether your baby has a genetic abnormality-instead, it gives the statistical likelihood of one. with that information in hand, you and your practitioner can then decide if further (more invasive, but conclusive) diagnostic testing, such as amniocentesis or cvs, is necessary. what exactly does nt measure? it focuses on a small, clear space in the tissue at the back of a growing baby\'s neck called the nuchal fold. experts have found that this spot tends to accumulate fluid and, as a result, expands in size in babies who have genetic abnormalities like down syndrome (caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain a human\'s genetic code), trisomy 18 (an extra copy of chromosome 18), and trisomy 13 (an extra number 13 chromosome). nt screening, which must be performed between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy (after that, the tissue gets so thick that it is no longer translucent, making test results inconclusive), is done with a highly sensitive ultrasound machine (but like a standard ultrasound, is considered safe). a sonographer will first measure your baby to confirm his or her gestational age before zooming in on the nuchal fold and measuring its thickness on the screen. those measurements, plus your age and baby\'s gestational age, will be entered into an equation that calculates the probability of a chromosomal abnormality. an nt screen is often part of routine prenatal testing during the first trimester and recommended for all women. while it\'s widely available, some areas- especially rural ones-may not have the machine and technicians with the expertise to perform the procedure. because increased nt measurements are also associated with fetal heart defects, your practitioner might suggest a fetal echocardiogram at around 20 weeks to screen for heart defects if your levels are high. increased nt measurements may also be linked to a very slightly higher risk of preterm birth, so you may be monitored for that as well if your nt results are high. combined screening (11 to 14 weeks). because nt results by themselves have an accuracy rate of just 70 to 75 percent (meaning that the test misses 25 to 30 percent of babies with down syndrome), your practitioner might offer what\'s referred to as a combined screening, in which the nt ultrasound results are combined with 1 or 2 blood tests that measure and compare your levels of 2 hormones, hcg and papp-a (pregnancy-associated plasma protein a), which are produced by the fetus and passed into the mother\'s bloodstream. by combining these blood tests with the nt screening, the accuracy of detection rates for down syndrome rises dramatically to between 83 and 92 percent. if your combined screening test shows that your baby may be at an increased risk of having a chromosomal defect, a test such as cvs or amniocentesis will be offered. if the screening test doesn\'t show an increased risk, your practitioner might recommend that you take the integrated screening test in the second trimester (see page 56) to rule out neural tube defects as well. remember, this screen doesn\'t directly test for chromosomal problems, and it can\'t diagnose a specific condition. rather, the results provide your baby\'s statistical likelihood of having a problem. an abnormal result

the same time, a normal result isn\'t an absolute guarantee that your baby is normal, but it does mean that it is extremely unlikely that your baby has a chromosomal defect. integrated screening (first and second trimesters). another screening test option that you may be offered combines measurements of the hormone papp-a and (possibly) nt from the first trimester with the measurements of the 4 hormones tested for in the second trimester quad screening (see below). combining the first and second trimester measurements gives a bit more sensitivity to the screening. quad screening (14 to 22 weeks). quad screening is a blood test that measures the levels of 4 substances produced by the fetus and passed into the mother\'s bloodstream: alpha-fetoprotein (afp), hcg, estriol, and inhibin-a. high levels of afp may suggest the possibility (but by no means the probability) that a baby is at higher risk for a neural tube defect. low levels of afp and abnormal levels of the other markers may indicate that the developing baby may be at higher risk for a chromosomal abnormality, such as down syndrome. the quad screening, like all screening tests, can\'t diagnose a birth defect-it can only indicate a higher risk. any abnormal result simply means that follow-up testing is needed. your doctor may recommend a quad screen instead of nipt screening because nipt may not be available in your area or may not be covered by your insurance. this screening is also less accurate than the nt screen combined with first-trimester blood work, so it\'s usually recommended only for moms-to-be who are already in their second trimester. when an abnormality actually exists, the quad screen is pretty good at detecting an increased risk of it- picking it up in approximately 85 percent of neural tube defect cases, nearly 80 percent of down syndrome cases, and 80 percent of trisomy 18 cases. but the false-positive rate for the independent quad screen is very high. only 1 or 2 out of 50 women with abnormal readings eventually prove to have an affected fetus-in all the rest, further testing shows that no abnormality exists after all. sometimes, it turns out that hormone levels tested outside of the normal range because there\'s more than one baby, other times it\'s because the edd is off (the fetus is either a few weeks older or younger than expected), and still other times it\'s because the test results were inaccurate or misinterpreted. if you get a positive result, you\'re carrying a single baby, and your ultrasound shows your dates are correct, you\'ll be offered amniocentesis as followup. but before you consider taking this or any action on the basis of a quad screening, be sure a genetic counselor or a doctor experienced in interpreting these types of screening tests has evaluated and verified the results. one other thing to consider when getting your quad screening results: studies indicate that women who receive abnormal results on their quad screen but receive normal results on follow-up testing such as amniocentesis may still be at very slightly increased risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as a small-for-gestational-age fetus, preterm delivery, or preeclampsia. talk to your practitioner about whether this might apply to you. level 2 ultrasound (18 to 22 weeks). even if you had an ultrasound in your first trimester to date your pregnancy (see page 170), you\'ll probably also get a screening ultrasound in your second trimester. this level 2 scan (also called an anatomy scan; see box, page 262) is much more detailed and focuses closely on fetal anatomy to make sure everything is growing and developing as it should. it also can be a lot more fun to look at, because it gives a far clearer picture of your baby-to-be than that first fuzzy one you got way back in trimester 1. a level 2 scan also checks for hard and soft markers, characteristics that may indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality. important to know before you head in for your scan: very few babies showing soft markers (choroid plexus cyst, echogenic foci, or pyelectasia, to name an unpronounceable few) end up having an abnormality. in fact, these markers are spotted on as many as 11 to 17 percent of all healthy babies-good reason not to worry if one is spotted on your baby\'s scan. your practitioner will let you know whether any follow-up testing is necessary (it often isn\'t). as with any ultrasound, a wand (transducer) is placed on your belly that sends sound waves through your body. the waves bounce off internal organs and fluids, and a computer converts those echoes into a 2-dimensional image (or a cross-sectional view) of the fetus on a screen. sometimes 3d or even 4d technology is used instead of 2d. during your level 2 ultrasound, you may be able to spot your baby\'s beating heart, the curve of the spine, and the face, arms, and legs. you may even catch sight of your baby sucking a thumb. usually, the genitals can be seen and the sex determined, although with less than 100 percent reliability and depending on baby\'s cooperation (if you\'d like to keep the sex a surprise until delivery, make sure you let your practitioner or technician know this in advance).","title" : "knowing the negatives of false positives"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 506,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "while just about every expectant mom will sign up for screening tests, going a step further to definitive diagnostic tests isn\'t for everyone. many parents-particularly those whose screening tests come back negative-can continue to play the waiting game, with the happy assurance that the chances are overwhelming that their babies will arrive completely healthy. but if you receive a positive result on a screening test, your practitioner may recommend following up with a diagnostic test to see if an abnormality actually exists, which it most often doesn\'t. other reasons why a mom-to-be might consider having prenatal diagnostic testing: having a family history of and/or being a carrier of a genetic condition, having had a baby with a birth defect, or having been exposed to an infection or substance that could possibly cause harm to a developing baby. unlike screenings, diagnostic tests, like chorionic villus sampling (cvs) and amniocentesis (amnio), analyze the genetic material in cells collected from baby\'s placenta or amniotic fluid. these tests are more accurate in detecting chromosomal abnormalities like down syndrome and, in the case of amnio, neural tube defects, because they directly test for problems-not just signs that possibly point to problems. you might want to consider speaking to a genetic counselor before taking diagnostic tests, just so you are armed with accurate information going in. why go through diagnostic testing if there\'s some risk involved? the best reason is the reassurance it usually brings. most of the time, diagnostic tests diagnose a perfectly healthy baby-which means that mom and dad can stop worrying and start enjoying their pregnancy. chorionic villus sampling (10 to 13 weeks). cvs is a first-trimester prenatal diagnostic test that involves taking a small tissue sample from the finger-like projections of the placenta called the chorionic villi and testing the sample to detect chromosomal abnormalities. because cvs is performed in the first trimester, it can give results (and most often, reassurance) earlier in pregnancy than amniocentesis, which is usually performed after the 16th week. cvs can detect (with 98 percent accuracy) a number of disorders, including down syndrome, tay-sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, and most types of cystic fibrosis. cvs can\'t test for neural tube and other anatomical defects. testing for specific genetic diseases (other than down syndrome) is usually done only when there is a family history of the disease or the parents are known to be carriers. cvs is most often performed by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in an ultrasound suite. depending on the location of the placenta, the sample of cells is taken via the vagina and cervix (transcervical cvs) or via a needle inserted in the abdominal wall (trans-abdominal cvs). neither method is entirely pain-free, and the discomfort can range from very mild to moderate. some women experience cramping (similar to menstrual cramps) when the sample is taken. both methods take about 30 minutes, start to finish, though the actual withdrawal of cells takes no more than a minute or two. in the transcervical procedure, you\'ll lie on your back with your feet in stirrups while a long, thin tube is inserted through your vagina into your uterus. guided by ultrasound imaging, transcervical cvs

that it\'s far from infallible. mistakes happen, even in the best labs and facilities, even with the most skilled professionals wielding the most high-tech equipment-with false positives being much more common than false negatives. that\'s why further testing and/or consultation with additional professionals should always be used to confirm a result that indicates there is something wrong with the fetus-and if that\'s confirmed, what the prognosis for your baby will be. the doctor positions the tube between the uterine lining and the chorion, the fetal membrane that will eventually form the fetal side of the placenta. a sample of the chorionic villi is then snipped or suctioned off for diagnostic study. in the transabdominal procedure, you\'ll also lie flat, tummy-up. ultrasound is used to determine the location of the placenta and to view the uterine walls. then, with continued ultrasound guidance, a needle is inserted through your abdomen and the uterine wall to the edge of the placenta, and the cells to be studied are drawn up through the needle. because the chorionic villi are of fetal origin, examining them can give a clear picture of the genetic makeup of the fetus. test results are available in 1 to 2 weeks. cvs is safe and reliable. the procedure carries a miscarriage rate equal to that of amnio-less than half a percent. choosing a testing center with a good safety record and waiting until right after your 10th week can further reduce the risks associated with the procedure. some vaginal bleeding can occur after cvs and shouldn\'t be cause for concern, though it should be reported. you should also let your doctor know if the bleeding lasts for 3 days or longer. since there is a very slight risk of infection with cvs, report any fever that occurs in the first few days after the procedure. if you\'re rh negative, you\'ll be given an injection of rh-immune globulin (rhogam) after the cvs to be sure the procedure doesn\'t result in rh problems later on (see page 35). amniocentesis (16 to 20 weeks). in this diagnostic test, which is usually done between weeks 16 and 18 of pregnancy, a long, thin, hollow needle is inserted through your abdomen, through the wall of the uterus, and into the fluid-filled amniotic sac. ultrasound is done at the same time, so your baby doesn\'t get accidentally poked by the needle (see illustration, page 60). you\'ll feel the prick and might experience some mild pain and cramping. about 1 to 2 tablespoons of the fluid are drawn out (don\'t worry, it will be quickly replenished) and sent to the lab for analysis. the fluid contains cells that your baby has sloughed off, plus chemicals. by analyzing this baby brew, your practitioner can assess the health of your fetus and look for certain medical conditions (such as down syndrome) caused by abnormalities in the chromosomes. the entire procedure-including prep time and ultrasound-will usually take about 30 minutes, start to finish (though the actual withdrawal of amniotic fluid takes no more than a minute or 2). if you\'re rh negative, you\'ll be given an injection of rh-immune globulin (rhogam) after the amniocentesis to be sure the procedure does not

every kind of abnormality, including cleft lip or palate, and it can\'t determine the severity of the problem. unlike cvs, amnio can also rule out neural tube defects (such as spina bifida). amnio is usually recommended if you\'re at high risk of certain abnormalities, had a previous child with a birth defect, have a family history of genetic conditions (unless you\'ve been screened and found that

pregnancies. following positive results on definitive diagnostic testing, you\'ll get (or you should ask for) a referral to experts, such as genetic counselor and/or a doctor specializing in your baby\'s condition, so you can learn about your options (including whether or not you might want to repeat the testing just to be sure the diagnosis is correct). you can also do your own research. after all, the more you know about your baby\'s condition and what you\'re facing as a family, the better prepared you can be (both emotionally and practically) for what lies ahead-whether it\'s receiving a child with special needs or coping with the inevitable loss of a baby. you\'ll also be able to begin working through the reactions (denial, resentment, guilt) that can come with discovering that your dreams of a perfectly healthy baby aren\'t coming true. joining a condition-specific support group-even one online-can help make coping somewhat easier, providing both answers and community. depending on your baby\'s condition, it may be recommended that you give birth at a specialized hospital, if possible. a specialized birth facility for labor and delivery can better address your specific needs or recommend medical interventions that, if performed immediately after birth, can improve your baby\'s quality of life. what\'s more, many of the hospitals that cater to high-risk births already have support groups result on a screening like nt, nipt, combined screen, or quad screen and you\'ve missed the first-trimester window for cvs (or opted not to get a cvs because that test can\'t detect neural tube defects). test results are usually back in 10 to 14 days. although most of the conditions detected by amniocentesis can\'t be cured, the test can let parents know about their baby\'s abnormality in advance. this gives them time to become informed about a condition, as well as make decisions about their baby\'s future health care or make the difficult decision to not continue the pregnancy. the news is rarely bad, however. more than 95 percent of the time amnio will find nothing but a healthy baby. (and if you\'d like to know the sex of your baby, amnio will give you that news, too.) after the procedure you\'ll be able to drive yourself home (some doctors recommend you have someone else drive you just to be on the safe side) and you\'ll probably be told to rest in bed for a few hours to a full 24 hours. you\'ll need to avoid sex, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, and flying for the next 3 days. you might experience minor cramping, but if cramps become severe or persistent, call your practitioner. also call if you notice leaking amniotic fluid or spotting, or if you develop a fever. complications from amnio are rare, but you should discuss them with your practitioner when considering the procedure. in their community outreach programs as well as specialized nicus (neonatal intensive care units) that can provide the best care for your baby if necessary. lining up a pediatrician with specialized training while you\'re still pregnant guarantees care specific to your little one\'s condition from the day he or she arrives. in some cases, an abnormality can be addressed prenatally. if your baby has a serious heart condition or spina bifida, for example, you may be able to opt for a prenatal procedure to correct it, if necessary, rather than waiting until after your baby is born. be sure to ask your practitioner whether your baby is a candidate for prenatal surgery. early interventions-such as therapy and other medical treatment-performed as soon as baby is born may also go a long way toward improving the prognosis for your little one, as well as his or her quality of life. if you\'ve been told your baby likely won\'t make it to term (since a fetus with certain chromosome disorders often won\'t survive a pregnancy) or may not live very long after birth, it may be possible to donate one or more healthy organs to an infant in need. some parents find that this provides some consolation for their own loss. a maternal-fetal specialist (or neonatologist) may be able to provide helpful information in such a situation and can help you prepare physically and emotionally for it. there are also numerous hospitals, hospices, and clinics that provide perinatal hospice and palliative care support for families who wish to continue their pregnancies with babies who likely will not live long after birth. if testing suggests a defect that will be fatal or extremely disabling, and retesting and interpretation by a genetic counselor confirms the diagnosis, some parents may make the agonizing decision, in consultation with their practitioner or other experts, to terminate the pregnancy. if you do, allow yourself time and space to grieve in the same way that moms-to-be who experience any kind of pregnancy loss need to.","title" : "if a problem is found"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 510,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'ve heard about the nesting instinct. is it pregnancy legend, or is it for real?\" the need to nest can be as real and as powerful an instinct for some humans as it is for our feathered and four-legged friends. if you\'ve ever witnessed the birth of puppies or kittens, you\'ve probably noticed how restless the laboring mother becomes just before delivery-frantically running back and forth, furiously shredding papers in a corner, and finally, when she feels all is in order, settling into the spot where she will give birth. many expectant humans do experience the uncontrollable urge to ready their nests, too, just prior to f o r f a t h e r s","title" : "nesting instinct"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 511,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "thinking about surprising your baby mama with a little box after she delivers your little bundle of joy?

how about some nipple twisting (double ouch)? stimulating your nipples for a few hours a day (yes, hours) can release your own natural oxytocin and bring on contractions. but here\'s the caveat: nipple stimulation-as enticing as hours of it may sound (or not)-can lead to painfully long and strong uterine contractions. not to mention very sore nipples. so unless your practitioner advises it and is monitoring your progress, you may want to think 4 times-twice for each nipple-before you or your partner attempt nipple stimulation. castor oil. hoping to sip your way into labor with a castor oil cocktail? women have been passing down this yucky-tasting tradition for generations on the theory that this powerful laxative will stimulate your bowels, which in turn will stimulate your uterus into contracting. the caveat for this one: castor oil (even mixed with a more appetizing drink) can cause diarrhea, severe cramping, and vomiting. before you chugalug, be sure you\'re ready to begin labor that way. herbal teas and remedies. raspberry leaf tea, black cohosh, and evening primrose may be just what your ancestors (and message board buddies) ordered for the overdue, and some studies show that these herbal remedies may actually help trigger or speed up contractions. ask your practitioner about whether (and how much) of these remedies you should take and how. and turn to them only when you\'re already at term. and while you\'re pondering the effectiveness of the diy approach, remind yourself that you will go into labor-either on your own or with a little help from your practitioner-eventually.","title" : "do-it-yourself labor induction?"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 517,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i\'d really love to share our baby\'s birth with my sisters, my best friend, and of course my mom. can they all be in the birthing room with my husband and me?\" a lready planning your labor (and delivery) party?

will you want everyone standing around chatting when you\'re craving peace and quiet (and rest)? will you feel obligated to entertain your guests or pay attention to your other kids when you need to be focused on birthing your baby? if you decide you\'d like the company, just remember to put flexibility on the list, too. remember (and remind your guests) that there\'s always the possibility your intended uneventful vaginal birth may turn into an unexpected c-section, in which case only the expectant dad will be allowed to follow the party into the or. or that you\'ll decide-say somewhere around the second hour of pushing-that you\'re not up for guests anymore and they might be shown to the door for delivery.

blob-like barrier that has corked your cervix throughout your pregnancy-often becomes dislodged as dilation and effacement begin. some women notice the popping of this mucous plug (what exactly is that in the toilet?), others don\'t (especially if you\'re the flush-and-rush type). though the passage of the plug is a sign that your body\'s gearing up for the big day, it\'s not a reliable signal that the big day has arrived-or even that it\'s around the corner. at this point, labor could be days, or even weeks, away, with your cervix continuing to open gradually over that time. in other words, there\'s no need to call your practitioner or frantically pack those last minute items into your bags just yet. there\'s also no need to worry about your baby\'s safety now that you\'re unplugged. in fact, your cervix continues to make mucus to protect the cervical opening and prevent infection, which means baby\'s still snugly sealed off-and it means that you can have sex, take a bath, and otherwise go about your business even after you\'ve lost your plug. no plug in your pants or your toilet? not to worry. many women don\'t lose it ahead of time, and that doesn\'t predict anything about the eventual progress of labor.","title" : "labor and delivery"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 531,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i have a pink mucousy

sheets will probably clue you in. if the wet spot smells sort of sweet (not like urine, which has the harsher odor of ammonia), it\'s probably amniotic fluid your sheets are soaked in-and that\'s a sign that your membranes have probably ruptured (your water has broken). another sign: you continue leaking the pale, straw-colored fluid. another test: you can try to stem the flow of the fluid by squeezing your pelvic muscles (kegel exercises). if the flow stops, it\'s urine. if it doesn\'t, it\'s amniotic fluid. you are more likely to notice the leaking while you are lying down. it usually stops, or at least slows, when you stand up or sit down, since baby\'s head acts as a cork, blocking the flow temporarily. the leakage is heavier-whether you\'re sitting or standing-if the break in the membranes is down near the cervix than if it is higher up. your practitioner has probably given you a set of instructions to follow if your water breaks. if you don\'t remember the instructions or have any doubts about how to proceed-call, night or day. \"my water just broke, but i haven\'t had any contractions. when is labor going to start, and what should i do in the meantime?\" i t\'s likely that labor\'s on the way-and soon. most women whose membranes rupture before labor begins can expect to feel the first contraction within 12 hours of that first trickle, while most others can expect to feel it within 24 hours. about 1 in 10, however, find that labor takes a little longer to get going. to prevent infection through the ruptured amniotic sac (the longer it takes for labor to get going, the greater the risk), most practitioners induce labor within 24 hours of a rupture if a mom-to-be is at or near her due date, and a few induce as early as 6 hours after. many women who have experienced a rupture actually welcome a sooner-than-later induction, preferring it to 24 hours of wet waiting. the first thing to do if you experience a trickle or flow of fluid from your vagina-besides grab a towel and a box of pads-is call your practitioner (unless he or she has instructed otherwise). in the meantime, keep your vaginal area as clean as possible to avoid infection: don\'t have sex (not that there\'s much chance you\'d want to right now), use a pad (not a tampon) to absorb the flow, don\'t try to do your own internal exam, and, as always, wipe from front to back when you use the toilet. rarely, when the membranes rupture before labor begins and the baby\'s presenting part is not yet engaged in the pelvis (more likely when the baby is breech or preterm), the umbilical cord can become \"prolapsed\"-it is swept into the cervix, or even down into the vagina, with the gush of amniotic fluid. if you can see a loop of umbilical cord at your vaginal opening, or

through the cervix into the uterus. this procedure, called amnioinfusion, can significantly reduce the possibility that a surgical delivery will become necessary because of fetal distress.","title" :

making a mother out of a pregnant woman. about 20 percent of pregnancies end up needing that kick in the maternity pants, and though a lot of the time induction is necessary because a baby is overdue, there are many other reasons why your practitioner might feel that nature needs a nudge, such as: ? your membranes have ruptured and contractions have not started on their own within 24 hours (though some practitioners induce much sooner). ? tests suggest that your uterus is no longer a healthy home for your baby because the placenta is no longer functioning optimally, amniotic fluid levels are low, or for another reason. ? tests suggest that the baby isn\'t thriving and is mature enough to be delivered. ? you have a complication, such as pre- eclampsia or gestational diabetes, or a chronic or acute illness that makes it risky to continue your pregnancy. ? there\'s a concern that you might not make it to the hospital or birthing center on time once labor has started, either because you

satisfying explanation. to find out all you\'ll need to know about the induction process, keep reading. \"how does induction work?\" induction, like naturally triggered labor, is a process-and sometimes a pretty long process. but unlike naturally triggered labor, your body will be getting some help with the heavy lifting if you\'re induced. labor induction usually involves a number of steps (though you won\'t necessarily go through all of these steps): ? first, your cervix will need to be rip- ened (or softened) so that labor can begin. if you arrive with a ripe cervix, great-you\'ll probably move ahead to the next step. if your cervix is not dilated, not effaced, and not soft at all, your practitioner will likely administer a hormonal substance such as prostaglandin e in the form of a vaginal gel (or a vaginal suppository in tablet form) to get things started. in this painless procedure, a syringe is used to place the gel in the vagina close to your cervix. after a few hours or longer of letting the gel do its work, you\'ll be checked to see if your cervix is getting softer and beginning to efface and dilate. if it isn\'t, a second dose of the prostaglandin is administered. in many cases, the gel is enough to get contractions and labor started. if your cervix is ripe enough but contractions have not begun, the induction process continues.

membrane sweeping) is one way your practitioner may try to jump-start labor-sometimes as part of the induction process in the hospital, sometimes during a regular prenatal visit when a mom is at or very near term. it\'s different from membrane rupturing, though it can lead to it. here\'s what you need to know about membrane stripping: how\'s it done? your practitioner will use his or her finger to gently separate the amniotic sac (aka bag of water) from the side of your uterus near the cervix. once the sac is separated, your body releases hormones (prostaglandins) that can eventually help get those contractions you\'re waiting for started. membrane stripping could be a one-time deal, or your practitioner may ask you to come back every few days to repeat the process if the first attempt didn\'t get labor going. even if your practitioner chooses to strip the membranes only once, you\'ll likely be asked to come back every few days to be checked for progress. what does it feel like? having your membranes stripped can be a little uncomfortable, though some women don\'t feel a thing. you might experience some crampiness for 24 hours after your membranes have been stripped (which may or may not lead to the labor contractions you\'re hoping for). you may also notice slight reddish, pink, or brown spotting for a few days afterward. all this is normal and nothing to worry about, though if you have severe pain or bright red bleeding, call your practitioner right away. but . . . does it work? there is some evidence that having your membranes stripped may fast-track you to the birthing room-just maybe not so fast (it could take 3 to 5 days or more before any of those real-deal contractions start). but since it\'s not a slam dunk for starting labor and it\'s no fun for moms, many experts say it shouldn\'t be done routinely. ripen the cervix, such as a catheter with an inflatable balloon, graduated dilators to stretch the cervix, or even a botanical-called laminaria japoni-cum-that, when inserted, gradually opens the cervix as it absorbs fluid around it and expands.) ? if the amniotic sac is still intact, your practitioner may strip the membranes (see box, above). or he or she may artificially rupture your membranes (see page 409) to try to get labor started. ? if you\'re still not having regular con- tractions, your practitioner will slowly administer intravenous pitocin, a synthetic form of the hormone oxytocin (which is produced naturally by the body throughout pregnancy and also plays an important role in labor), until contractions are well established. the drug misoprostol, given through the vagina, might be used as an alternative to other ripening and induction techniques. ? your baby will be continuously moni- tored to assess how he or she is dealing with the stress of labor. you\'ll also be monitored to make sure the drug isn\'t overstimulating your uterus, triggering contractions that are too long or powerful. if that happens, the rate of infusion can be reduced or the process can be discontinued entirely. once your contractions are in full swing, the oxytocin may be stopped or the dose decreased, and labor should progress just as a nonin-duced labor does. you can also get an epidural at this point if you\'d like. ? if, after 8 to 12 hours of oxytocin administration, labor hasn\'t begun or progressed, your practitioner might stop the induction process to give you a chance to rest before trying again or, depending on the circumstances, the procedure may be stopped in favor of a cesarean delivery.","title" : "membrane

eating be on the menu when you\'re in labor? that depends on who\'s placing the orders. some practitioners red-light all food and drink during labor, on the theory that food in the digestive tract might be aspirated, or \"breathed in,\" in the very, very unlikely case that emergency general anesthesia becomes necessary. these practitioners usually okay ice chips only, supplemented as needed by intravenous fluids. most other practitioners (and guidelines from acog), however, allow liquids and light solids (read: no stuffed-crust pizza) during a low-risk labor. these folks logically figure that a mom doing the hard work of labor needs both fluids and calories to stay strong and effective. besides, they point out, the risk of aspiration (which, again, exists only if general anesthesia is used, which it rarely is except in emergency situations) is extremely low: 7 in 10 million births. their position has even been backed up by research, which shows that moms who are allowed to eat and drink during labor have shorter labors by an average of 90 minutes. non-fasting moms are also less likely to need oxytocin to speed up labor, require fewer pain medications, and have babies with higher apgar scores than moms who are forced to fast. check with your practitioner to find out what will and won\'t be on the menu for you during labor. even if your practitioner gives you the go-ahead on eating, chances are you won\'t be in the market for a major meal once the contractions begin in earnest (and besides, you\'ll be pretty distracted). after all, labor can really spoil your appetite. still, an occasional light, easy-to-digest snack during the early hours of labor-popsicles, jell-o, applesauce, cooked fruit, a banana, plain pasta, toast with jam, or clear broth are ideal choices-may help keep your energy up at a time when you need it most (you probably won\'t be able to, or won\'t want to, eat during the later parts of active labor). when deciding-with your practitioner\'s help-what to eat and when, also keep in mind that labor can make you feel pretty nauseous. some laboring moms throw up, even if they haven\'t been eating. whether you can chow down or not during labor, your coach definitely can-and should (you don\'t want him weak from hunger when you need him most). remind him to have a meal before you head off to the hospital or birthing center

epidural?\" that depends a lot on hospital pol-icy. in some hospitals, it\'s routine to give all women in labor an iv, a flexible catheter placed in your vein (usually in the back of your hand or lower arm) to drip in fluids and medication. the reason is precautionary-to prevent dehydration, as well as to save a step later on in case an emergency arises that necessitates medication (there\'s already a line in place to administer drugs-no extra poking or prodding required). other hospitals and practitioners omit routine ivs and instead wait until there is a clear need before hooking moms up. check out policies in advance, and if you strongly object to having a routine iv, ask your practitioner if it can be skipped. it may be possible to hold off until the need, if any, comes up. you\'ll definitely get an iv if an epidural is on the agenda. iv fluids are routinely administered before and during the placement of an epidural to reduce the chance of a drop in blood pressure, a common side effect of this pain relief route. the iv also allows for easier administration of pitocin in case labor needs a nudge. if you end up with a routine iv or an iv with epidural that you were hoping to avoid, you\'ll probably find it\'s not all that intrusive. the iv is only slightly uncomfortable as the needle is inserted-after that, you shouldn\'t even notice it (and if you do, tell your nurse). when it\'s hung on a movable stand, you can take it with you to the bathroom or on a stroll down the hall. if you very strongly don\'t want an iv but hospital policy dictates that you receive one, ask your practitioner whether a heparin lock might be an option for you. with a heparin lock, a catheter is placed in the vein, a drop of the blood-thinning medication heparin is added to prevent clotting, and the catheter is locked off. this option gives the hospital staff access to an open vein should an emergency arise but doesn\'t hook you up to an iv pole unnecessarily-a good compromise in certain situations.","title" : "routine iv"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 546,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"will i have to be hooked up to a fetal monitor the whole time

most moms, the episiotomy-a surgical cut in a mom\'s perineum made to enlarge the vaginal opening just before the baby\'s head emerges-is no longer performed routinely at delivery. these days, in fact, midwives and most doctors rarely make the cut without a good reason, and only about 10 percent of delivering moms end up getting one. it wasn\'t always that way. the episiotomy was once thought to prevent spontaneous tearing of the perineum and postpartum urinary and fecal incontinence, as well as reduce the risk in the newborn of birth trauma (from the baby\'s head pushing long and hard against the perineum). but it\'s now known that infants fare just fine without an episiotomy, and moms, seem to do better without it. skipping the procedure doesn\'t seem to make the average total labor any longer, and moms often experience less blood loss, less infection, and less perineal pain after delivery without an episiotomy (though you can still have blood loss and infection with a tear). what\'s more, research has shown that episiotomies are more likely than spontaneous tears to turn into serious third- or fourth-degree tears (those that go close to or through the rectum, sometimes causing fecal incontinence, or the inability to control bowel movements). but while routine episiotomies are no longer recommended, there is still a place for them in certain birth scenarios. episiotomies may be indicated when a baby is large and needs a roomier exit route, when the baby needs to be delivered rapidly, when forceps or vacuum delivery needs to be performed, or for the relief of shoulder dystocia (a shoulder gets stuck in the birth canal during delivery). if you do need an episiotomy, you\'ll get an injection (if there\'s time) of local pain relief before the cut, though you may not need a local if you\'re already anesthetized from an epidural or if your perineum is thinned out and already numb from the pressure of your baby\'s head during crowning. your practitioner will then take surgical scissors and make either a median (also called midline) incision (a cut made directly toward the rectum) or a mediolateral incision (which slants away from the rectum). after delivery of your baby and the placenta, the practitioner will stitch up the cut (you\'ll get a shot of local pain medication if you didn\'t before or if your epidural has worn off). if you haven\'t already, discuss the episiotomy issue with your practitioner. it\'s very likely he or she will agree that the procedure should not be performed unless there\'s a good reason. document your feelings about episiotomies in your birth plan, too, if you like. but keep in mind that, very occasionally, episiotomies do turn out to be necessary, and the final decision should be made in the delivery or birthing room-when that cute little head is crowning. so if you fit in that category, you probably won\'t have to be attached to a fetal monitor for your entire labor (you almost certainly won\'t be if you\'re delivering with a midwife). if, however, you\'re being induced, have an epidural, or have certain risk factors (such as meconium staining), you\'re most likely going to be hooked up to a monitor throughout your labor. there are three types of continuous fetal monitoring: external monitoring. in this type of monitoring, used most frequently, 2 devices are strapped to the abdomen. one, an ultrasound transducer, picks up the fetal heartbeat. the other, a pressure-sensitive gauge, measures the intensity and duration of uterine contractions. both are connected to a monitor, and the measurements are recorded on a digital and paper readout. when you\'re connected to an external monitor, you\'ll be able to move around in your bed or on a chair nearby, but you won\'t have complete freedom of movement, unless telemetry monitoring is being used (see below). during the second (pushing) stage of labor, when contractions may come so fast and furious that it\'s hard to know when to push and when to hold back, the monitor can be used to accurately signal the beginning and end of each contraction. or the monitor may be removed entirely while you\'re pushing, to make sure it doesn\'t interfere with your concentration. in this case, your baby\'s heart rate will be checked periodically with a doppler. internal monitoring. when more accurate results are

and a catheter is placed in your uterus or an external pressure gauge is strapped to your abdomen to measure the strength of your contractions. though internal monitoring gives a slightly more accurate record of the baby\'s heart rate and your contractions than an external monitor, it\'s used only when necessary (since its use comes with a slight risk of infection). your baby may have a small bruise or scratch where the electrode was attached, but it\'ll heal in a few days. you\'ll be more limited in your movement with an internal monitor, but you\'ll still be able to move from side to side. telemetry monitoring. available only in some hospitals, this type of monitoring uses a transmitter on your thigh to transmit the baby\'s heart tones (via radio waves) to the nurse\'s station- allowing you to take a lap or two around the hallway while still having constant monitoring. be aware that with both internal and external types of monitoring, false alarms are common. the machine can start beeping loudly if the transducer has slipped out of place, if the baby has shifted position, if mom has shifted position, if the monitor isn\'t working right, or if contractions have suddenly picked up in intensity. your practitioner will take all these factors and others into account before concluding that your baby really is in trouble. if the abnormal readings do continue, several other assessments can be performed (such as fetal scalp stimulation) to determine the cause of the distress. if fetal distress is confirmed, then a cesarean delivery is usually called for.","title" :

see next question) and c-section under the right circumstances. what are the right circumstances? vacuum extraction might be considered when the cervix is fully dilated and the membranes have broken but a mom is just too exhausted from labor to push effectively or to keep pushing, or if she has a heart condition or very high blood pressure that might make strenuous pushing risky. the procedure might also be used if the baby needs to be delivered in a hurry because of possible distress (assuming the baby is in a favorable position-for example, close to crowning). babies born with vacuum extraction experience some swelling on the scalp, but it usually isn\'t serious, doesn\'t require treatment, and goes away within a few days. if the vacuum extractor isn\'t working successfully to help deliver the baby, a cesarean delivery will likely be performed. before turning to vacuum extraction, your practitioner may suggest (time permitting) letting you rest up for a few contractions before trying to push again (sometimes even a short break can give you the second wind you need to push your baby out effectively). a change of position (getting on all fours, squatting with a birthing bar, sitting on a birthing ball) might also push delivery along by enlisting the force of gravity to shift baby\'s head. ask your practitioner any questions you have about the possible use of vacuum extraction (or forceps, see next question), including whether you\'ll need an episiotomy before a vacuum delivery. the more you know, the better prepared you\'ll be for anything that comes your way during childbirth.","title" : "vacuum extractor"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 550,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"how likely will it be that i\'ll need forceps during delivery?\" p retty unlikely these days. forceps-long, curved tonglike devices designed to help a baby make his or her descent down the birth canal-are used in only a very small percentage of deliveries (vacuum extraction is more common;

see facing page). the rocking motion may allow your pelvis to open and encourage your baby to descend. and again, staying upright allows you to use the force of gravity to help in the process. leaning over. many laboring moms-to-be find it relaxing to lean forward during contractions-and it\'s an especially helpful position if you\'ve got back labor. stack a bunch of pillows on a bed or table and lean forward on them, resting your head and arms on the pillows and relaxing your body. this position is also helpful if you want to sway or rock but don\'t have the energy to hold your body up. sitting. whether in bed (the back of the birthing bed can be raised so you\'re almost sitting upright), in your partner\'s arms, or on a birthing ball, sitting can ease the pain of contractions and may allow gravity to help coax your baby down into your birth sitting leaning over canal. another option, if it\'s available, is a birthing chair, specifically designed to support a woman in labor. a plus: moms get to see more of the birth in this position. on a birthing ball. sitting on one of these large exercise balls can help open up your pelvis-and it\'s a lot easier than squatting for long periods. the curve of the ball gives a slight counterpressure to the perenium during labor. if you\'d rather lean forward on your hands and knees (see illustration, next page), take advantage of the curve of the ball to rock back and forth (or side to side or even in gentle circles). using the ball for support this way can help with back labor and can also take the strain off your wrists while still a l lowing you to labor in whatever position feels best for you. kneeling. got back labor? kneeling over a birthing ball, a chair, or over your spouse\'s shoulders can be soothing and productive when the back of baby\'s head is pushing against your spine. it on a birthing ball encourages the baby to move forward, taking that load off your back. even if you don\'t have back labor, kneeling can be an effective labor and delivery position. because it allows you to shift and transfer some of the pressure toward the lower spine while you push your baby out, kneeling seems to reduce childbirth pain even more than sitting does. hands and knees. getting on all fours is another way to cope more comfortably with back labor-and to help get that puppy out faster. this position allows you to do pelvic tilts for comfort while giving your spouse or doula access to your back for massage and counterpressure. you might even consider delivering in this position (no matter what kind of labor you\'re having), since it opens up the pelvis and uses gravity to coax baby down. (you can also use a birthing ball in this position; see above.) kneeling squatting. you probably won\'t be able to stand and deliver, but once you get closer to the pushing stage of childbirth, you might want to consider squatting. there\'s a reason why women have delivered their babies in a squatting position for centuries: it works. squatting allows the pelvis to open wide, giving your baby more room to move on down. you can use your partner for squatting support (you\'ll probably be a little wobbly, so you\'ll need all the support you can get), or you can use a squatting bar, which is often attached to the birthing bed (leaning on the bar will keep your legs from tiring out as you squat- ask if one will be available ahead of time if you think you might want to use it). hands and knees side lying. too tired to sit? or squat? just need to lie down? lying on your side (left side is best) is much better than lying on squatting your back, since it doesn\'t compress the major veins

childbirth (and the passage of that 7- or 8-pound baby) and then-over a period of weeks after delivery-return to close to original size. in other words, your vagina\'s definitely designed to take it. the perineum is also elastic but less so than the vagina. massage during the months before delivery (and during delivery) may help increase its elasticity and reduce stretching in a first-time mom (though it\'s not a must-do; see page 384). likewise, exercising the pelvic muscles with kegels during this period may enhance their elasticity, strengthen them, and speed their return to normal tone. most women find that the slight increase in vaginal roominess typically experienced postpartum is imperceptible and doesn\'t interfere at all with sexual enjoyment. for those who were previously too snug, that extra room can be a real plus-making sex more of a pleasure and in some cases, literally, less of a pain. very occasionally, however, in a woman who was \"just right\" before (or a couple who were a perfect fit before), childbirth does stretch the vagina enough that sexual satisfaction decreases. often, the vaginal muscles tighten up again in time. doing kegels faithfully and frequently helps speed that process. if 6 months after delivery you still find that your vagina\'s too slack for comfort, talk to your doctor about other possible treatments. remember that the best labor position is the one that\'s best for you. and what\'s best in the early phases of labor might make you miserable when you\'re in the throes of labor, so change positions as often-or as little-as

the perineum (the area between your vagina and your anus) and sometimes the cervix as well. as many as half of all women who deliver vaginally will experience at least a small tear during delivery

most common types of tears. in most cases, a tear requires stitches (they\'re generally required in tears that are longer than 2 cm, or about 1 inch). after the tear is repaired, you\'ll likely experience tenderness at the site as it heals over the next week to 10 days. but here\'s the good news: recovering from a small tear that happens naturally is a lot easier than healing after an episiotomy-a procedure that\'s (thankfully) rarely used these days in uncomplicated births (see box, page 408). to reduce the possibility that you\'ll tear, some experts recommend perineal massage (see page 384) for a few weeks before your due date if you\'re a first-time mom. (if you\'ve delivered vaginally before, you\'re already stretched, so do-ahead massage probably won\'t accomplish much.) during labor, the following can also help: warm compresses to lessen perineal discomfort, perineal massage with oils or lubricants, standing or squatting and exhaling or grunting while pushing to facilitate stretching of the perineum. during the pushing stage, your practitioner will probably use perineal support (applying gentle counterpressure to the perineum so your baby\'s head doesn\'t push out too quickly and cause an unnecessary tear) and perineal massage. doesn\'t increase the risk of a mom hemorrhaging, but may offer real benefits to baby. a clamping delay after delivery allows the placenta to give a few more pulses of blood to the newborn, and this extra dose of blood can represent as much as 30 to 40 percent of a baby\'s blood volume. and pumping up that blood supply can significantly improve a baby\'s iron and hemoglobin levels, preventing anemia in the first 6 months of life. and how\'s this for a possible (if unexpected) perk: delayed cord clamping may boost social and fine motor skills later in life. how long a wait is long enough?

of course not-you\'d like to keep labor moving. and making good progress during labor-which happens most of the time-requires three main components: strong uterine contractions that effectively dilate the cervix, a baby that is in position for an easy exit, and a pelvis that is roomy enough to permit passage of the baby. but in some cases, labor doesn\'t progress by the book, because the cervix takes its time dilating, the baby takes longer than expected to descend, or pushing isn\'t getting you (or your baby) anywhere. contractions can also slow down after an epidural kicks in, too- but keep in mind that expectations for the progress of labor and delivery are different for those who have an epidural (first and second stage may take longer, and that\'s typically nothing to worry about). to get a stalled labor back up and running, there are a number of steps your practitioner (and you) can take: ? if you\'re in early labor and your cer- vix just isn\'t dilating or effacing, your practitioner may suggest some activity (such as walking) or just the opposite (sleep and rest, possibly aided by relaxation techniques). this will also help rule out false labor (the contractions of false labor usually subside with activity or a nap). ? if you\'re not dilating or effacing as quickly as expected, your practitioner may try to rev things up by administering pitocin (oxytocin), prostaglandin e, or another labor stimulator. he or she might even suggest a labor booster that you can take into your own hands (or your coach\'s): nipple stimulation. ? if you\'re already in the active phase of labor, but your cervix is dilating ? if you\'d like some pain relief, now\'s a good time to ask for it. an epidural can be given as early as you feel you need it and as soon as an anesthesiologist can get to your room. ? stay hydrated. with your practitio- ner\'s green light, drink clear beverages frequently to replace fluids and to keep your mouth moist. if you\'re hungry, and again, if you have your practitioner\'s okay, have a light snack (like a jell-o or popsicle). if your practitioner doesn\'t allow anything else by mouth, sucking on ice chips can be refreshing. ? stay on the move if you can (you won\'t be able to get around much if you have an epidural). walk around, if possible, or at least change positions as needed (see page 412 for suggested labor positions). taking a shower or soaking in a tub now can help ease your pain, if you don\'t have an epidural. ? pee periodically. because of tremen- dous pelvic pressure, you may not notice the need to empty your bladder, but a full bladder can prevent baby\'s descent and keep you from making the progress you\'ll definitely want to be making. no need to trek to the bathroom if you have an epidural (not that you could anyway), because you\'ve probably been given a catheter to empty your bladder. slowly (less than 1 to 1.2 cm per hour if you\'re having your first baby and 1.5 cm per hour if you\'ve delivered before), or if your baby isn\'t moving quickly enough down the birth canal (at a rate of more than 1 cm per hour if you\'re a first-timer or 2 cm per hour if you\'re not), your practitioner may rupture your membranes and/or start (or continue) administering oxytocin. some practitioners (especially midwives) will encourage a woman to labor longer than this before resorting to interventions-as long as baby\'s heart rate is good and mom doesn\'t have a fever. ? if you\'re a first-time mom, you\'ll probably be allowed to push for 3 hours if you haven\'t had an epidural and 4 hours if you have. if you\'re a second-timer or more, you\'ll probably be allowed to push for 2 hours if you haven\'t had an epidural and 3 hours if you have had one. if the pushing goes on too long, your practitioner will reassess your baby\'s position, see how you\'re feeling, perhaps attempt to birth your baby using vacuum extraction or (less likely) forceps, or decide to do a cesarean delivery. to keep the ball (and the baby) rolling throughout labor, remember to urinate periodically, because a full bladder can interfere with the baby\'s descent. (if you have an epidural, chances are your bladder is being emptied by a catheter.) full bowels may do the same, so if you haven\'t moved your bowels in 24 hours, give it a try. you might also try to nudge a sluggish labor along by using gravity (sitting upright, squatting, standing, or walking). when it comes to giving slow pushing a push, a semi-sitting, semi-squatting, or all-fours position may help deliver results. most practitioners will turn to a cesarean delivery after 24 hours of active labor (sometimes sooner) if sufficient progress hasn\'t been made by that time. some will wait longer, assuming both mom and baby are doing well.","title" : "when labor slows down"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 567,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "labor\'s getting more active, and that means you\'ll be getting busier supporting your laboring spouse. here are some ways you can help her: ?

good choices include swimming or pregnancy water aerobics, stretching, prenatal yoga, light weight training, and riding a stationary bicycle, all exercises that don\'t require you to be on your feet while you do them (though do ask your practitioner if walking is safe in your case-it is most of the time). and don\'t forget your kegels (page 229), the anywhere-anytime exercises designed to strengthen your pelvic floor (which needs extra reinforcement when there are extra babies inside). no matter what you\'re doing during your workout, if the exertion is causing braxton-hicks contractions or raising any other red flags listed on page 140, stop immediately, rest, drink some water, and call your practitioner if they don\'t subside within 20 minutes or so.","title" : "extra, extra!"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 574,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"everybody thinks it\'s so exciting that we\'re going to have twins, except us. we\'re scared and even disappointed. what\'s wrong with us?\"","title" : "mixed feelings"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 575,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "a s a multiples mother-to-be, you\'re about to join a special club already filled with thousands of women just like you-women who are also expecting double the delight and, chances are, double the self doubt. never been a joiner?

(keep in mind that term for twins is considered 38 weeks, not 40.) after all, as cozy as it can be for your little ones in the uterus, it can also get pretty crowded as they grow. be sure you know the signs of preterm labor, and don\'t hesitate to call your practitioner right away if you\'re experiencing any of them (see page 559). low birthweight. since many multiple pregnancies end early, the average (repeat: average) baby born of a multiple pregnancy arrives weighing 5� pounds, which is considered low birth-weight. most 5-pounders end up doing just fine health-wise, thanks to advances in caring for these small newborns, but babies born weighing less than 3 pounds are at increased risk for health complications as newborns, as well as for long-term disabilities. making sure your prenatal health is in top-notch condition and your diet contains plenty of nutrients (including the right amount of calories) can help get your babies to a bigger bottom line. see what to expect the first year for more on low-birthweight babies. twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (ttts). this in-utero condition, which happens in about 9 to 15 percent of identical twin pregnancies in which the placenta is shared, arises when one or more placental arteries from one twin deposits blood in the placenta that returns to the other twin through a placental vein. if there aren\'t other common vessels present to equalize the delivery of blood to both fetuses, the result can be one baby getting too much blood and the other too little.

or maybe one (or more) of each? how multiples will end up at delivery time (and how you\'ll end up delivering) is anybody\'s guess. here\'s a look at the possible ways your twins may be presenting and the likely delivery scenarios for each situation. vertex/vertex. this is the most cooperative position that twins can wind up in on delivery day, and they wind up in it about 40 percent of the time. if both your babies are vertex (heads down), you\'ll likely be able to go into labor naturally and attempt a vaginal birth. keep in mind, however, that even perfectly positioned singletons sometimes need to be delivered by c-section. this goes double for twins. if you\'re hoping to have a midwife attend your delivery (or even if you\'d like to deliver at home), the vertex/vertex position is the best-case scenario. vertex/breech. the second-best-case scenario if you\'re hoping for a vaginal birth for your twins is the vertex/ breech setup. this means that if baby a is head-down and well positioned for delivery, it may be possible for your practitioner to manipulate baby b from the breech position to vertex after baby a is born. this can be done either by applying manual pressure to your abdomen (external version) or literally reaching inside your uterus to turn baby b (internal version). the internal version sounds much more complicated than it is-because baby a has essentially warmed up and stretched out the birth canal already, the procedure is over with pretty quickly. (still, an arm reaching into your uterus to pull out a baby isn\'t pretty without pain meds-another reason why many doctors strongly recommend epidurals for multiples moms.) if baby b remains stubbornly breech, your practitioner may do a breech extraction, in which your baby is pulled feet first right out the exit. breech/vertex or breech/breech. if baby a is breech or if both your babies are bottoms-down, your practitioner will almost certainly recommend a c-section. though external version is commonplace for breech singletons (and can work in the above mentioned vertex/breech multiple pregnancy), it\'s considered too risky in this scenario. baby a oblique. who knew there were so many positions for babies to lie in? when baby a is oblique, it means his or her head is pointed down, but toward either of your hips rather than squarely at your cervix. in a singleton pregnancy with oblique presentation, a practitioner would probably try external version to bring the baby\'s head where it needs to be (facing the exit), but that\'s risky with twins. in this case, two things can happen: an oblique presentation can correct itself as contractions progress, resulting in a vaginal birth, or more likely, your practitioner will recommend a c-section to avoid a long, drawn-out labor that may or may not lead to a vaginal birth. transverse/transverse. in this setup, both babies are lying horizontally across your uterus. a double transverse almost always results in a c-section. got triplets (or more) in there? your babies can assume any number of these positions (and maybe even keep you guessing until right up to delivery). see facing page for more on triplet delivery. this is usually done only when an emergency situation has come up that puts baby b at risk, such as placental abruption or cord prolapse. (those all-important fetal monitors tell your doctor just how well baby b is doing after baby a\'s arrival.) a mixed delivery is definitely not fun for mom. in the moment, of course, it can be very scary, and after the babies are born, it means recovery from both a vaginal birth and a surgical one-a big double ouch. but when it\'s necessary, it can be a baby-saving procedure, well worth the added recovery time. planned cesarean delivery. possible reasons for this plan include a previous c-section (a vbac, or vaginal birth after cesarean, is not common practice for multiples), placenta previa or other complications, or fetal positions that make vaginal delivery unsafe. with most planned c-sections, your spouse, partner, or coach can accompany you into the or, where you will probably be given an epidural or a spinal block. you may be surprised by how fast it all goes after you\'re numb: baby a\'s and baby b\'s birth times will be separated by anywhere from seconds to just a minute

out that you\'re going to meet your babies the same day. best to be prepared, so in those later weeks of pregnancy, be sure to get your bag packed and ready to go. reasons for a surprise cesarean delivery include conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction (where the babies run out of room to grow) or a sharp rise in your blood pressure (preeclampsia). an unplanned c-section scenario may also arise during labor if there are any signs of distress in the babies or if you labor for a very long time and don\'t progress at all. a uterus holding 10 or more pounds of babies may be too

you stand up in the first few days is normal-it\'s just the flow that accumulates when you\'ve been lying down or sitting. because blood and an occasional blood clot are the predominant ingredients of lochia during the immediate postpartum period, your discharge can be quite red for anywhere from 5 days to 3 weeks, gradually turning to a watery pink, then to brown, and finally to a yellowish white. maxipads, not tampons, should be used to absorb the flow, which may continue on and off for just a couple of weeks or for as long as 6 weeks. in some moms, light bleeding continues for as long as 3 months. the flow is different for everyone. breastfeeding-and/or pitocin, which is routinely ordered by some practitioners (either via iv or a shot) after delivery-may reduce the flow of lochia by encouraging uterine contractions. these postdelivery contractions (aka afterpains, see next question for more) help shrink the uterus back to its normal size more quickly while pinching off exposed blood vessels at the site where the placenta separated from the uterus. if you\'re in the hospital or birthing center and you think your bleeding may be excessive, let a nurse know. once you\'re home,

lightly below your navel. by the end of 6 weeks, you probably won\'t feel it at all. afterpains can definitely be a pain, but they do important work. besides helping the uterus find its way back to its usual size and location, those contractions help slow normal postpartum bleeding. they\'re likely to be more of a pain in women whose uterine muscles are lacking in tone because of previous births or excessive stretching (as with a multiple pregnancy). afterpains can be much more intense during nursing, when contraction-stimulating oxytocin is released (a good thing, actually, since it means

a tear or episiotomy will take time to heal, usually 7 to 10 days. pain alone during this time, unless it is very severe, is not a sign that you\'ve developed an infection. what\'s more, infection (though possible) is really very unlikely if you\'ve been taking good care of the area. while you\'re in the hospital or birthing center, a nurse will check your perineum at least once daily for any signs of infection, like inflammation. the nurse will also instruct you in postpartum perineal hygiene, which is important in preventing infection not only of the repair site but of the genital tract

doesn\'t come easily for most brand new moms during the first 24 postpartum hours. some feel no urge at all, and others feel the urge but are unable to satisfy it. still others manage to pee, but with pain and burning. there are a host of reasons why basic bladder function often becomes too much like hard work after delivery: ? the holding capacity of the bladder increases because it suddenly has more room to expand-so your need to pee may be less frequent than it was during pregnancy. ? the bladder may have been trau- matized or bruised during delivery. temporarily paralyzed, it may not send the necessary signals of urgency even when it\'s full. ? having had an epidural and/or a cath- eter may decrease the sensitivity of the bladder or your alertness to its signals. ? perineal pain may cause reflex spasms in the urethra, making urination difficult. swelling of the perineum may also stand between you and an easy pee. ? the sensitivity of the site of a tear or water on the area while you pee can also decrease discomfort (use the squirt bottle you were probably given and shown how to use). ? you may be dehydrated, especially if you didn\'t do any drinking during labor, and didn\'t receive iv fluids. ? any number of psychological fac- tors may keep you from going with the flow: fear of pain, lack of privacy, embarrassment over using a bedpan or needing help at the toilet. as difficult as peeing may be, it\'s essential that you empty your bladder within 6 to 8 hours after delivery (or after the removal of any catheter) to avoid a uti, loss of muscle tone in the bladder from over-distension, and excessive bleeding (because an overfull bladder can get in the way of your uterus as it attempts the normal postpartum contractions that stanch bleeding). with those marching orders in mind, the nurse will ask you frequently after delivery if you\'ve accomplished this important goal. you might even be asked to deposit that first postpartum pee into a container or bedpan, so your output can be measured. the nurse may palpate your bladder to make sure it\'s not distended. to help get things flowing: ? be sure you\'re drinking plenty of flu- ids: what goes in is more likely to go out. ? take a walk. getting out of bed and going for a slow stroll as soon after delivery as you\'re able will help get your bladder (and bowels) moving. ? squirt warm water over your perineal area to induce urgency. you can also try warming your perineum in a sitz bath or chilling it with an ice pack ? turn the water on while you try. running water in the sink really does encourage your own faucet to flow. if all efforts fail and you haven\'t peed within 8 hours after delivery, your practitioner may order a catheter to empty your bladder-another good incentive to try the methods above. after 24 hours, the problem of too little generally becomes one of too much. most new moms usually begin urinating frequently and plentifully as the excess fluids of pregnancy are excreted. if you\'re still having trouble peeing, or if output is scant during the next few days, it\'s possible you have a uti (see page 528). \"i can\'t seem to control my urine. it just leaks out.\" the physical stress of childbirth can put a lot of things temporarily out of commission, including the bladder. either it can\'t let go of the urine-or it lets go of it too easily, as in your drippy case. such leakage (called urinary incontinence) occurs because of loss of muscle tone in the perineal area. kegel exercises can help restore the tone and help you regain control over the flow of urine. see page 492 for more.","title" : "difficulty urinating"}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 596,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "\"i delivered 2 days ago and i haven\'t had a

to get past that milestone, the more anxious-and the more uncomfortable-you\'re likely to become. several physical factors may interfere with the return of bowel-business-as-usual after delivery. for one thing, the abdominal muscles that assist in elimination have been stretched during childbirth, making them flaccid and sometimes temporarily unable to help out. for another, the bowel itself may have taken a beating during delivery, leaving it sluggish. and of course, it may have been emptied before or during delivery (remember that prelabor diarrhea? the poop that you squeezed out during pushing?), and stayed pretty empty because you didn\'t eat much solid food during labor. but it\'s the psychological factors that most inhibit postpartum pooping: the fear that it will hurt, split open any stitches, or make your hemorrhoids worse; the natural embarrassment over lack of privacy in the hospital or birthing center; and that pressure to \"perform.\" in other words, it\'s mind over fecal matter. here are some steps you can take to get things moving again: don\'t worry. nothing will keep you from moving your bowels more than worrying about moving your bowels. don\'t stress about opening the stitches-you won\'t. finally, don\'t worry if it takes a few days to get things moving-that\'s okay, too. request roughage. if you\'re still in the hospital or birthing center, select as many whole grains (bran cereal or muffins), beans, and fresh fruits (but not bananas) and salads from the menu as you can. if you\'re home, make sure you\'re eating regularly and well-and that you\'re getting your fill of fiber. as much as you can, stay away from bowel-clogging foods like white bread and rice. keep the liquids coming. not only do you need to compensate for fluids you lost during labor and delivery, but you need to take in additional liquids to help soften stool if you\'re clogged up. water\'s always a winner, but you may also find apple or prune juice especially effective. hot water with lemon can also do the trick. get off your bottom. an inactive body encourages inactive bowels. you won\'t be running laps the day after delivery, but you will be able to take short strolls up and down the halls. kegel exercises, which can be practiced in bed almost immediately after delivery, will help tone up not only the perineum but also the rectum. at home, take walks with baby. don\'t strain. straining won\'t break open any stitches you have, but it can lead to or aggravate hemorrhoids. if you already have hemorrhoids, you may find relief with sitz baths, topical anesthetics, witch hazel pads, suppositories, or hot or cold compresses. use stool softeners. many hospitals send new moms home with both a stool softener and a laxative, for a reason: both can help get you going. the first few bowel movements may be a pain to pass. but fear not. as stools soften and you become more regular, discomfort will ease and eventually end-and moving your bowels will become second nature once again.","title" : ""}},"add" : {"doc" : {"id" : 598,"author" : "heidi murkoff","bibliography" : "","body" : "wondering when you\'ll be able to bring baby home? how long you

mature milk has two components to it: foremilk and hind-milk. when your little one starts to suckle, the foremilk quenches baby\'s thirst, but not his or her appetite. as the nursing session
