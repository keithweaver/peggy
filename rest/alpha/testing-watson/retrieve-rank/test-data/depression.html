<h1>Depression</h1>
<p>Around 15 percent of women of childbearing age battle bouts of depression, so you’re far from alone. Luckily for you and all the other expec- tant moms who share your condition, there’s a sunny forecast: With the right treatment, women with depression can have perfectly normal pregnancies— and happy ones, too. Deciding what that treatment should consist of during pregnancy is a delicate balancing act, however, when it comes to the use of medications. Together with your mental health care provider and your prena- tal practitioner, you’ll need to weigh the risks and benefits of taking such meds— and not taking them—while you’re growing a baby.</p>

Maybe it seems like a simple deci- sion to make, at least at first glance. After all, could there ever be a good reason to put your emotional wellbeing over your baby’s physical wellbeing? But the deci- sion is actually a lot more complicated than that. For starters, pregnancy hor- mones can do a number on your emo- tional state. Even women who’ve never had an encounter with mood disorders, depression, or any other psychological condition may experience wild emo- tional swings when they’re expecting— but women with a history of depression are at greater risk of having depres- sive bouts during pregnancy and are more likely to suffer from postpartum depression. And this is especially true for moms-to-be who stop taking their antidepressants during pregnancy.

What’s more, untreated depres- sion isn’t likely to affect only you (and those you’re close to)—it’s also likely to affect your baby’s health. Depressed moms-to-be may not eat or sleep well or pay as much attention to their prenatal care, and they may be more likely to turn to unhealthy lifestyle habits, like drinking or smoking. Any or all of those factors, combined with the debilitating effects of excessive anxiety and stress, have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and a lower Apgar score for babies. Treating depression effec- tively, however—and keeping it under control during pregnancy—allows a mother-to-be to nurture her body and her developing baby.

So what does all this mean for you? It means you should think twice before you consider tossing your antidepres- sants. But it also means that you should consult both with your prenatal practi- tioner and the doctor and/or therapist who has been treating you for depres- sion before you decide what your next medication move should be, if any. Certain meds are safer than others dur- ing pregnancy, and some aren’t recom- mended for pregnancy use at all—which means that the med (or meds) you used preconception might not be the right choice now. Or that your dose may need to be changed.

Your prenatal practitioner (in con- junction with your mental health care provider) can give you the most up-to- date and accurate information on the safety of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy, because it’s ever chang- ing—as well as often misinterpreted or misreported on the internet. Another reason to look to professional guidance (instead of search engines): Research so far has been conflicting, with some stud- ies showing increased risk for autism, cardiac defect, and low birthweight in babies whose moms took certain anti- depressants during pregnancy, and other studies showing no correlation at all. What is known right now is that the SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) Celexa, Prozac, and Zoloft are generally considered good options during pregnancy (Paxil, another SSRI, is not, because it’s associated with a small increase in fetal heart defects). SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors) such as Cymbalta and Effexor XR, are also among the treatment options for expectant moms. Wellbutrin isn’t considered a first choice medication during pregnancy but can be used if a woman isn’t responding to the other options.

Here’s the important thing to keep in mind as you and your practitioner weigh your options: Though taking any kind of medicine during pregnancy— including antidepressants—isn’t with- out risks, experts believe these risks shouldn’t keep pregnant women from taking antidepressants if their depres- sion can’t be treated effectively in other ways. That’s because untreated depres- sion carries its own risks, many with long-term effects. Choosing the safest medication possible, prescribing it at the safest dose possible, and taking it at the safest time during pregnancy as pos- sible will help mitigate the risks of both the depression and the medications.

Also remember that there are non- drug treatments for depression that can be quite effective, either on their own (in some cases, allowing a mom with mild depression to avoid medication altogether) or when used in conjunc- tion with medication (allowing a mom to take a lower dose of a medication or switch to a safer med). These treatments include psychotherapy (talk therapy), bright light therapy, and complemen- tary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches, such as acupuncture and possibly neurotherapy. Exercise (for its release of feel-good endorphins), meditation (which can help you man- age stress), and diet (keeping blood sugar up with regular healthy meals and snacks) can also be beneficial additions to a treatment program. Talk to your practitioner and mental health care pro- vider to see if these options have a place in yours.
