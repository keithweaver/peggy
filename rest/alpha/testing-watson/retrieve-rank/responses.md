	  "ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties . there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc . in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate . physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow . the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly . the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams . one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products . the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction . the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are .. (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory ."

	  "the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year . the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space . the practical question which required an answer was .. would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated . an ideal problem is here discussed . a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form . the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated . it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air . the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front . as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate . at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy . in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment ."

	  "an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method . the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream . the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics . an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down . by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation . in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs . employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock . the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave . analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution . the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics . to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number . these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement ."

				  "ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties . there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc . in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate . physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow . the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly . the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams . one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products . the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction . the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are .. (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory ."

				  "the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year . the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space . the practical question which required an answer was .. would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated . an ideal problem is here discussed . a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form . the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated . it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air . the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front . as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate . at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy . in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment ."

				  "an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method . the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream . the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics . an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down . by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation . in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs . employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock . the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave . analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution . the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics . to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number . these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement ."
